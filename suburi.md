# Suburi

**Suburi** is the act of swinging the shinai or bokuto up and down vertically or diagonally. The purpose of suburi is to learn how to handle the shinai or bokuto, the correct direction of its movement \(**ha-suji**\), the proper grip for striking, and the basic strking movements related to **ashi-sabaki** \(footwork\) and **tai-sabaki**\(body action\).

Basic suburi are **Joge Suburi** \(vertical swing\) and **naname suburi** \(diagonal swing\). **Kukan Datotsu** is suburi where one practices strike the targets of **men**, **kote**, **do**, and **tsuki** to an imaginary opponent.

In the Kamae chapter we discussed the correct posture, grip and stance for Chudan-no-kame. To master suburi, it is essential all these elements are followed correctly. A solit platform is required for correct cutting.

The elements needed for correct suburi are:

**Furi-kaburi** \(furi-kaburu\) - swing the arms and shinai up above the head. **NB**: The shoulders should be the center of rotation for the swing - avoid bending wrists and elbows inwards.

**Furi-oroshi** \(furi-orosu\) - swing the shinai down from an upward position and strike.

**Furu** - to move the shinai, continuously up and down or diagonally right and left.

#### Joge Suburi \(also Joge-buri\)

* Starting from the correct Chudan-no-kamae position: 

_**NB**: The manuals state that we should swing the shinai without changing the grip. Some sensei suggest moving the right hand close to the lef of gripping with both hands together in the center of the tsuka, to make action easier when learning - others say to keep normal grip - do as Instructor asks, but either way - Do NOT allow hands to slide up and down Tsuka during swing - hand position must remain constant._

**Furi-Kaburi**

* Swing the shinai upward in a large movement keeping left and right hands perfectly centered.
* The feeling should be of pushing the left hand forwards and up over the head, raising the hands and elbows as far as shoulders will allow. \(DO NOT pull it up with the right hand - this arm must remain relaxed.\) Think of lifting elbows up as far as you can.
* The shoulders are the point the arms and shinai rotate around, the oter joints should not move initially.
* Keep the shoulders down and relaxed - do not "hunch" them up during swing.

**NB**: The size of the swing varies with different Sensei's ideas. Some say that it should only swing back parallel to the floor,
