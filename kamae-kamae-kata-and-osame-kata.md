# Kamae, Kamae-kata and Osame-kata

## Kamae

Kamae is the guard, or ready posture employed for attack and defense. However, more than just a physical pose, kamae is also the on-guard posturing of the mind and spirit. These aspects of kamae, the body and mindset, must always be practiced together. Equally important to keep in mind is that kamae begins and ends with proper etiquette. These points are never to be overlooked.

There are three processes of kamae. They are assuming kamae, withdrawing from kamae and Kamae O-toku - kamae at-ease or open kamae.

The legendary swordsman, Miyamoto Musashi \(1584-1645\) distinguished in his writings five primary guard postures collectively termed **Goho-no-Kamae**. In modern kendo, the goho-no-kamae continues to be the principal guard postures. The goho-no-kamae are **chudan-no-kamae, jodan-no-kamae, degan-no-kamae, hasso-no-kamae, and waki-kamae**. Of the five, **chudan-no-kamae** is the first and most versatile of the guard postures. In modern kendo, chudan-no-kamae is the posture that the other four kamae are instigated from.

### Chudan no Kamae

Left grip at the end of **Tsuka** \(handle\), in front of the navel, right hand near but not touching the **Tsuba** \(guard\), "V" between the thumb and index finger of both hands over the top of the **Tsuka**, left grip with last three fingers hold the **Shinai**, while right hand with last two fingers lightly support it, **Kensen** towards the opponent's throat, **Tsura**\(string\) is up, right foot forward, with of a foot between feet, left heel slightly off the floor, left knee straight but not locked.

### Hand position

The anatomy of the hand includes the tora-kuchi. The tora-kuchi is the angle at the base of the index finger and thumb. The tora-kuchi and the tsuru or the seams of the tsuk-gawa \[leather handle covering\] are the keys to positioning the hands in relation to the shinai's circumference. The tsuru indicates the upright side of the shinai in its drawn attitude. In its correct configuration, the tsuru also marks the top center line of the shinai. The hands should be positioned on the shinai in such a manner that the top center line of the shinai runs through the apex of the tora-kuchi of both hands.

![Tora no Kuchi](https://b9bexa.dm.files.1drv.com/y4mshaNARUJPK39CmyTIoKza7kReH3ftfDKzMzWonoXCL21fMGGg6DNRvipZnWdMQIKe2H7U4TtQ9xAyFO6kwIaSLs_hkyztlxvgLm5R6JOIpP4yA95dlaan-mVI27d3Vhf4Lt1EfUPsiA2S_atTB7wOcF-zgBDV5ia_Gl_p35sY3bwv_0wiAeGGyNsmwXYP-O6JP2iOZGO2XFKs0bEAxaudQ?width=876&height=616&cropmode=none)

The left hand is positioned at the end of the tsuka, clasping the tsuka-gashira midway into the little finger. \[**NB**: Holding bokuto, the left hand should just reveal the tsuka-gashira\]

The forward position of the right hand is generally one-and-a-half fists ahead of the left hand. A common method for establishing the forward position of the right hand is to:

* Bend the right arm at the elbow
* Place the hilt of the shinai in the joint of the elbow
* Grasp the shinai with the right hand. Where the hand grasps the shinai is the point of placement for the right hand.
* The right hand should almost touch the tsuba of the shinai \(more than 2cm of tsuka\) means it is the wrong length and needs adjusting.

**Hand grip**

The shinai should be gripped firmly, not tightly, as if holding an egg without crushing the shell. Both hands grip in a similar manner, but the left grip should be firmer than that of the right hand.

To grip the shinai:

* Extended the hand as if reaching out to give a handshake greeting.
* Position the hilt of the shinai on the inside portion of the heel of the hand.
* Grasp the shinai firmly with the little and ring fingers.
* Grip the shinai with the middle finger using moderate \(not tight or loose\) pressure.
* The index finger and thumb remain relaxed.
* The right hand is positioned appropriately on the shinai, as previously outlined, and grips the shinai in the same manner as the left hand, with slightly less pressure.

**Main points**:

1. Throughout the process of strikes and techniques, the hand positioning and grip should never change.
2. The hands should not grip the shinai squarely. A square grip is usually the result of including the index fingers and thumbs in gripping the shinai. Such a grip will restrict the flexibility and movement of the hands.
3. The hilt of the shinai should be held at the very end. The overlapping of the small finger halfway over the end of the shinai is an acceptable practice. However, never is the shinai to be held with the hilt protruding from the heel of the left hand. \[**NB**: Holding a **Bokuto**, the left hand should just reveal the **tsuka-gashira**\]
4. The right hand should not grasp the shinai directly below the tsuba.

In **chudan-no-kamae** \(or **chudan**\), the shinai held in the centre-plane of the body with the tip projecting forward to the opponent. Below, details the correct positioning of the hands and shinai in relation to the body and the opponent.

1. The left hand is extended approximately the with of one fist \(10cm\) forward of the abdomen.
2. The first joint of the thumb \(at the base of the thumb\) is in a direct line in front of the navel.
3. The shinai is angled forward, tsuru \(cord\) upwards, projecting the line of the shinai to the opponent's throat, face or left eye.
4. The elbows should not stick out, but be relaxed, with a slight between them and the body - they would just touch your **do** lightly. Have the feeling of holding an egg in each armpit.

**NB**: The height of the Kensen can vary in certain instances, but should not be higher than your opponent's throat or lower than his Kote. It must also remain close to the centre, always pointing within opponent's body/throat area. To quote the **All Japan Kendo Federation Dictionary**: "... the extension of the ken-sen \(tip of the shinai\) points between the opponent's eyes". However they also add within there "**kihon-kata**" tet "From **issoku-itto-no-maai** \(one-step one-strike interval\) the line of the kensen should extend to a point on the face between the eyes or towards the left-eye." However in there Fundamental Kendo manual, and Nippon Kendo Kata text they state that the shinai or bokuto "... is held so that the tip \(**kissaki**\) points toward the opponent's throat."

![Hand Grip](https://b9aqxa.dm.files.1drv.com/y4m5-5LJo_HpySjzoqc8sEAKymYdbFvrYDQfZCNr2wC1CQMw0Omlv__HvVA1Qg2vMb9heEWWLoEFsw9TG23nwffiA103L2tuHYR6SDQHh0gPjzG_GtSvR2ukDHYpDLo5DHnIyTdi-tkB-HRb7zz5Hx_xsfmBQA0b_Z-ifnbx6VYRkSqLRlWmfdTNap0DlCc3xu7moJ7DfCbHp9UVcNQoXORGQ?width=696&height=308&cropmode=none)

_The projected line of the shinai is called the "kensen." However more than just a noun for a positional reference, kensen includes functional principles. The understanding and application of kensen is the key in maneuvering, attacking, and forestalling an opponent. this aspect is presented here as an introduction, only. The concept and the actual application can only be acquired through diligent training._

_If the kensen drops to low, the shinai becomes vunerable to being struck down, giving the opportunity to strike Men using Hari-otoshi or Kote-Men, If the kensen rises to point above the head, it no longer exerts pressure on opponent, and is also an opportunity to strike kote._

_Keeping the kensen at a level where the opponent can only see its tip seems to about the correct level. This provides a threat to opponent, requiring the displacement of the shinai to make an opportunity. From this position, pushing hands or body forwards, the shinai tip should strike the **nodo**\(throat\), as in **tsuki** attack._

### Foot position

As noted in the coming section, **Ashi sabaki**, footwork is the most important aspect in kendo practice. Good footwork begins with correct foot positioning.

In their correct position, the feet are separated by approximately the width of one fist \(10cm\) with the toes pointed directly forward. The heel of the right foot should be aligned with the big toe of the left foot. The heel of the right foot should be resting lightly on the floor while the heel of the left foot should be elevated to a natural height off of the floor. The body weight is centered between the feet with the strength of mobility focused in the lower part of the legs from the knees downward. The upper body, form the knees upward, remains relaxed. While the left leg should remain straight, the knee must not be locked. The position of the left foot / leg is vital.

![Ashi sabaki](https://b9apxa.dm.files.1drv.com/y4mXSNWp9Ts12hpZdXNEBSEE332XE16zVFflDXu0NfThHpIe8QV3q6eYahsKDSWLCMIiQj30JGUEMHQ0X_-DIferVxc1SDY-B3dvEfYv1i9RIjZdLfXUNFMjLsc0myD8S5piTXoR0a2tDuws_TQKWMdblshFt1edaw9jbn4xXdIym5OPeSUSMOMRiwKWpTjC5RY6-Wi-oqfke8APzewMZhYGg?width=1048&height=598&cropmode=none)

There are two common methods used to aid in foot positioning.

1. The first methods starts from **shizen-tai** with the heels of the feet together and the toes pointed 30 degrees outward. Pivot on the balls of the feet and rotate the heels outward to point the toes directly forward. Step forward with the right foot to a point where the heel is aligned with the big toe of the left foot.
2. In the second method, the right foot is positioned with the toes pointed directly forward. The heel of the left foot is placed against the heel of the right foot with the toes pointed 90 degrees outward \(to the left\). From this position, pivot the heel of the left foot outward to point the toes directly forward. The feet should now be in their correct position.

By taking a natural step forward and halting mid-step \(so right heel in line with left toes\) the left heel will naturally raise, and with the weight evenly \(50:50\) distributed on both fee, you should naturally take correct posture.

**Conditions to avoid**:

* The toes should not point outward. Such a stance may seem stable; however, it is unstable when moving backcward and **fumikiri** \(push of the rear leg\) is slow and weak. Toes should point forwards towards your opponent.
* Avoid a stance where the feet are in a line. this is an unstanble stance and movement in any direction is difficult.
* Do not position the feet closer together than prescribed. This foot position may have some benefit in forward and backward movements, but is unstable. It is also weak when receiving an opponent's t**ai-atari** \( body check\)
* When the feet are extended too far apart in their forward-back relation, movement in all directions becomes awkward. Additionally, such a stance lowers the body height and allows an opponent to dominate in stature.

![Incorrect Foot work](https://b9bbxa.dm.files.1drv.com/y4mByMwyJrjkgBmBJJAbQEKxU9O2lX62o3bJwsAq98-WFftup6Mu1AOiDLVKB9xiOEXtBteYtG1KQ73d1goQc8gl0G2q-SbKrpzNBIeJ08wO9YVjn1nEv-1CrOVYzrR6TtS9wfSJVYS2JxPpuqjWAv7RCUlXtgYJVxbhsrqfBkEynY5e4UehnZm85uJ22-x_5AGE9tuIKP1ZL6Kkf1JEf3QyQ?width=1110&height=378&cropmode=none)

**Hip position**:

Hip should be kept square to the front, with the buttocks tucked in. This allows the left leg/foot to be positioned correctly. When pushing or lunging forwards, your body will then keep straight. This also helps the left foot to quickly return to its position behind the right foot. It is essential to provide a stable and balanced platform to allow correct striking.

### Eyes-Metsuke

* **Metsuke** is the positioning of one's eyes. It is the act of observing the opponents whole, while looking into his eyes. Some kendo sayings used to try explain the feeling are:
* **Enzan no Metsuke** means that you look at your opponent as if you are looking at a far away mountain. That is too look at the opponent as a whole, rather than focusing on one point.
* **Kan-ken-no-metuske** is the teaching of the importance of having a keen eye which can not only see the opponent's appearance, but can also perceive the opponents abilities, state of mind and intentions. \(Read Gorin no Sho by Miyamoto Mushashi for more details.\)

These ideas are all very deep, and require study. To begin with:

* Watch the eyes: opponent looking at the target before striking \(don't get tricked\)
* Watch the **Kensen** and wrists \(especially right Kote\) to spot initiation of technique.
* Watch the shoulders. As they breathe out is a good time to attack them.
* Watch oneself - check your own position for weakness.

### Assuming Kamae \(with Shinai\)

* Stand in **shizen-tai** with the shinai held in **sage-to**.

**Sage-to** \(also **Tei-to**\): the holding of the shinai in a relaxed attitude while standing in shizen-tai. The sinai is held naturally at the side with the hilt angled slightly inward. Viewed from the side, the shinai should be held at a 45-degree angle. The tsuru of the shinai is positioned on the downward side.

* Execute **Moku-rei**. Keep the grasp of the shinai relaxed and do not change the position or angle of the shinai as the bow is performed. Ask your partner to please train **Onegai shimasu**.
* Raise the shinai to the **Tai-to** position.

**Tai-to**: the standing posture with the shinai held in a drawing attitude. From **sage-to**, the shinai is raised to the hip with the hilt of the shinai directly forward of the bellybutton. The pad of the thumb is placed on the tsuba, slightly to the inside \(right\) fro the center of the shinai.

* Draw the Shinai - "**Nuke-to**"

**Nuke-to**: push out your shinai a little forward and start drawing your shinai towards your opponent. At the same time, take a small step forward onto the right foot.

\*When drawing the shinai with the right hand, the left hand stays still.

\*Flip your sword forward in a large arc to the front, and grab the shinai with the left hand.

When you stop here, you are ready to go in the **chudan** position.

* Assume the sonkyo position.

**Sonkyo**: turn in your left heel, and bend at the knees to lơer the hips. Sonkyo is a posture taken to show respect before and after a match or training evolution. When in this squatting posture, correct upper body posture is maintained. The knees are opened outward with the thighs forming a 90-degree angle. The body is balanced on the balls of the feet and the shinai is held in chudan \(center guard position\).

* Stand and take a step forward with the right foot to bright the feet into proper guard position.

### Kamae-kata: Assuming Kamae with partner \(Shinai practice\)

1. Face each other in the **sage-to** posture at a separation of nine steps.
2. Execute **ritsu-rei**.
3. Bright the shinai to the **Tai-to** position.
4. Take three steps forward starting with the right foot.
5. Draw the shinai, "**nuke-to**", on the third step and assume the **sonkyo** position.
6. Stand and take a step forward with the right foot to bright the feet into proper guard position.

### Osame-kata - Withdrawing from kamae

Replacing the Shinai is the reverse sequence

1. From the chudan-no-kamae posture.
2. Turn in your left heel, and bend the knees and lower the hips to assume the sonkyo position.
3. Withdraw the shinai - "**Osamae-to** \(reverse nuke-to action\)" to the **tai-to** position and then straighten the legs to stand.
4. Step back starting with the left foot.
5. Lower the shinai to the **sage-to** position.
6. Perform **Moku-rei**, and thank your partner **arigatou gozaimashita**.

**Main points**

* Proper upper body posture should always be maintained.
* When drawing the shinai, grasp the tsuka from the underside so the tsuru will come to rest on the topside of the shinai after the shinai is drawn. Conversely, when withdrawing the shinai the shinai should be rotated to bring the tsuru to rest on the downward side.
* When taking sonkyo with a partner, careful consideration should be given to the distance to the center starting point - upon taking three steps and drawing the shinai, the shinai tip should be with in the center area of the court or training floor.
* When in the sonkyo position with a partner, the tips of the shinai should be separated by two to ten centimeters.

### Kamae O-toku \(normal instruction "Yasume" in Shinai kendo\)

Assume a relaxed or at-ease posture with the shinai drawn. From chudan-no-kamae, turn the shinai downward to point the kisaki to just outside the opponent's left knee. The kisaki should be at a level five or six centimeters below the knee. The edge of the shinai \(side opposite the tsuru\) should be angled downward and to the inside at approximately 45 degrees.
