# Kendo Training Handbook

Kendo is a traditional Japanese martial art, as well as Athletic sport. How do you think of and practice it will change and develop over the time to practice the art. This guide is a summary of my understandings, and so, as a disclaimer, I cannot guarantee that these are thoughts of everyone, including myself in future times.

Over the years I have practiced Kendo, I have learnt and been taught many ideas, in many ways. I have, from the advice I have received and ideas taught to me, compiled my notes, and have selected those ideas I found most useful myself, and that were a common idea among many Sensei. To avoid changing ideas beyond those of Kendo, I have set the basic standard as that described in the All Japanese Kendo Federation manuals.

Where differences appear in teaching idea, I have commented in _Italiques_ to give some guidance.

I set the basic elements needed for practice to master basic Kendo, and teach the skills needed to face an opponent, these begin the **Kihon-dosa** as described by the **All Japanese Kendo Federation**.

## **Kihon-dousa**

1. **Shisei**: Posture
2. **Kamae**: Stance or posture
3. **Metsuke**: Use of eyes
4. **Kamae-kata**: The way of drawing the bokuto/shinai
5. **Osame-kata**: The way of putting away bokuto/shinai
6. **Ashi-sabaki**: Foot work
7. **Suburi**: Swinging the shinai
8. **Kake-goe**: Vocalisation
9. **Ma-ai**: Distance between oneself and opponent
10. **Kihon no uchi kata**, **Tsuki-kata**, and **Uke-kata**: Basic ways of string, thrusting and receiving strikes
11. **Kiri-kaeshi**: Continuous striking center, right-left men
12. **Tai atari**: Colliding with opponent
13. **Tsuba-zerai**: Fighting close with the sword guards.
14. **Zanshin**: Keeping alert with correct posture after cutting

I have adjusted the order to fit in with the logical progression of practice and contents of this list to include notes on Reigi-Saho \(Etiquette and Manners\).
