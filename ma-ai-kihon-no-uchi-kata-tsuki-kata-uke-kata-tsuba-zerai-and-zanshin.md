# Ma-ai, Kihon-no-uchi-kata, Tsuki-kata, Uke-kata, Tsuba-zerai and Zanshin

## Ma-ai

**Ma-ai** is the spatial distance between you and your opponent. The establishment of **ma-ai** through relationship with the opponent is a subtle and important matter.

1. **Chika-ma \(Chika ma-ai\)**: closer distance, when you get in further from issoku itto no ma, you are in chika-ma. You can easily reach your opponent but your opponent also can reach you easily.
2. **Issoku itto no ma-ai \(Issoku itto no ma\)**: this distance is a distance where you can reach you ropponent with one step forwards and you can avoid your opponent's cut with one step backwards. The fundamental spatial distance in Kendo.
3. **To-ma \(To ma-ai\)**: distance beyond **issoku itto no ma**. You cannot reach your opponent and your opponent cannot reach you. Basiclaly your shinai and your opponent's shinai are not touching \(or barely touching\).
4. **Uchi ma \(Uchi ma-ai\)**: the distance for you to strike. One's optimum distance and opportunity for striking. When learning, start close to make keeping posture easy, then increase distance - try to be able to strike from as far as possible.

It is easy to strike from **Chika-ma**; beginners should focus on practicing **Keiko** from **To-ma** to encourage fast ashi-sabaki and large fluid striking.

Closing from to-ma is when one must be fully prepared to attack or be attacked - there is no chance to relax.

## Kihon-no-uchi-kata - The basic way of striking and Tsuki-kata - Thrusting

We can learn, practice and improve our cutting with Suburi, but we need an opponent to learn about distance and striking effectively.

We should practice striking with Bokuto to just above the target, and striking the target with Shinai - either to the Bogu or shinai held close to actual target position, so not to effect cutting distances.

Praciticing in pairs, the term **Kakarite** is used for the one striking \(practicing technique\) and **Motodachi** used for the receiver of the strike or technique. Both must maintain alertness during practice as both roles are vital.

**Kakarite** must always maintain posture and pressure to be ready to cut immediately any opportunity to strike. The height of the **kensen** in **kamae** will vary with the size of one's opponent, as will your **uchi-ma**. When in **kamae** adjust the **kensen** level by moving the left fist position rather than bending the wrist. When cutting your right hand should finish around your opponents shoulder level.

**Motodachi** must help maintain correct Ma-ai and provide correct opportunities to be struck.

* Open for **Men** by moving **Kensen** to your right, or lowering it to the right.
* Open for **Kote** by raising the **kensen** to the left - at first, exaggerate movement to make **kote** easy to strike.
* Open for **Do** by raising arms to reveal target,a nd sometimes turn body to the right to offer larger target.
* Open for **Tsuki** by lowering **kensen** down to the right - keep chin pulled in to receive.

If not wearing Bogu then use the shinai to receive strikes. Do not hold it arms stretched out as mentioned in the Suburi section as this will effect  **Ma-ai** - instead hold close to where actual target would be, in such a way you are still protected.

* **Men** - hold shinai in both hands just in front and above the head, or with hands in that position, shinai out to your side.
* **Kote** - hold shinai in stretched out hands at position **Kote** would normally be, or with hands in that position, shinai out to your side.
* **Do** - hold shinai in both hands, right hand low down close to your right hip and left ahnd by right shoulder. The vertical shinai is then in similar position to the **Do**.
* **Tsuki** - not normally practiced by beginners except in style of bokuto ni yoru kendo kihon waza keiko ho.

First one must master **Reigi - Kamae - Ashi sabaki**  and **Suburi**. Then you must learn and develop effective **Kihon**. Keep in mind some important ideas:

* Strike must be with sufficient force to cut with a real sword. Not to soft or too hard - **Men** and **Do** are struck more firmly than the **Kote**
* You must always keep contol of posture and kamae.
* Strikes are not made by force of strngth, but bu the correct action of arms and wrists.
* Do not think of striking with the right hand, strike with the left. Do not think of striking with the left ahnd, but strike with the hips, legs, and feet - use all your body.
* Do not put strength into lifting the shinai, relax arms, and strike quickly.

### Steps to Kihon Waza

1. Focus on large proper **Furi-kaburi, Ki-ai**, and **Te-no-uchi** from a stationary position where **Datotsu-bui** \(striking zones\) can be reached without moving.
2. From **Issoku-itto-no-ma-ai**, step one step in using **Suri-ashi** to strike to add **Ashi-sabaki** and **Ki-ten-tai-no-itchi** practice.
3. From **Issoku-itto-no-ma-ai**, build up pressure, and then step one step in and strike using **Fumi-komi-ashi** and **Ki-ten-tai-itchi**. Here one learns and improves their **Uchi-ma** \(ptimim distance and opportunity for cutting\)
4. From a far distance \(**Toma**\), step into **Issoku-itto-no-ma-ai** with **Suri-ashi**, then use sharp **Fumi-komi** to strike and follow through with **Zanshin**.

#### Step 1: Statinary Shomen Uchi

* From **Chudan-no-kamae** at a distance where Datotsu-bu can be reached without step.
* **Furi-kaburi** large swing up until left fist is above forehead.
* **Kiritsuke: Shomen Uchi**: cut Men with left fist in front of chest; right arm extended and almost parallel to floor, both hands squeeze slightly inward in \(**Chakin-shibori**\)
* and \(**Te-no-uchi**\) wrist snap, express sharp loud **Ki-ai**: "MEN!"
* Do both actions in one continuous motion \(**Ik-kyo-do**\) - no pause between **Furi-kaburi** and **Kiritsuke Men**-**uchi**.

#### Step 2: Okuri Ashi Shomen Uchi

* From **chudan-no-kamae** at a distance of **Issoku-itto-no-ma-ai** \(where one step required to reach the target.\)
* One step forward from right with **Suri-ashi** as **Shinai** swing up **Furi-kaburi** above head as in above practice, and immediately.
* **Kiritsuke - Men-uchi** strike as you bright left foot up to proper position behind the right.
* At the moment of striking, express **Ki-ai** - "MEN!" or "ICHI!"
* **Ki-ai, Hiki-tsuke** \(pulling up left foot\) and strike must be simultaneous - **Ki-ten-tai-itchi**.
* Retreat from left foot in one small **Okuri-ashi** step to show **Zanshin** in **Chudan-no-kamae**.
* Retreat from left foot, in another small **Okuri-ashi** steep, to original distance/position, maintaining **Chudan-no-kamae**.

#### Step 3: Fumikomi ashi shomen uchi - Issoku-itto-no-ma-ai \(One step cut\)

* From **chudan-no-kamae** at a distance of **Issoku-itto-no-ma-ai** \(where one step required to reach the target - start at easy distance, then try to increase it maintain posture.\)
* When **Moto-dachi** \(opponent\) opens their shinai to their right
* **Furi-kaburi** swing up shinai above head as in above practice, and immediately.
* Step forward and **Kiritsuke** **- Men-uchi**. Strike Men while stepping decisively forward with the right foot, and expressing **Ki-ai** - "MEN!" the stepshould be large enough to reach the opponent at **Issoko-itto-no-ma-ai**. When striking, **Ki-ai**, stamping **Fumi-komi-ashi**, and strike must be simultaneous - **Ki-ten-tai-itchi**.
* Immediately bright the left foot to proper position \(**hiki-tsuke**\); use quick **Okuri-ashi** \(suri-ashi\) to protect straight forward; relax hands; keep the arms extended until ready to return to **Chudan-no-kamae**.

_**NB**: Several ways of continuing after cutting which are useful to practice are:_

1. _Continue just 1 step forward and stop at tsuba-zerai \(see later\) - takes 2 steps back._
2. _Continue straight forward 3-4 steps while Motodachi retreats - Kakarite keeping shinai close to men target. Assume chudan and reverse roles._

#### Step 4: Seme - Fumikomi ashi shomen uchi - Toma \(two step action\)

* From **Chudan-no-kamae** at a distance of **To-ma** \(where one cannot reach the target in one step - Kisaki not touching.\) express **Ki-ai** \(Yaah!, Aeii!, etc\)
* Take on step into **Issoku-itto-no-ma-ai** with **suri-ashi**
* Advance right foot/knee/body slightly while maintaining **Kensen** position to apply pressure \(**seme-ashi**\)
* When **Motodachi** \(opponent\) opens their shinai to their right
* Immediately, \(**Ik-kyo-do** in one motion\) **Furi-kaburi** swing up shinai above head as in above practice, **kiritsuke - men-uchi** strike **Men** while stepping decisively forward with the right foot, and expressing **Ki-ai** - "Men!" the step should be large enough to reach the opponent at **Issoko-itto-no-ma-ai**. When striking, **Ki-ai**, stamping **Fumi-komi-ashi**, and strike must be simultaneous - **Ki-ten-tai-itchi**.
* Immediately bring the left foot to proper position; use quick successive **Okuri-ashi \(suri-ashi\)** to proceed straight forward 3 to 4 fast steps; relax hands; keep the arms extended until ready to turn shortest way towards opponent - steps slow slightly to turn with good posture, with eye contact and return to **chudan-no-kamae**, at **to-ma** or **issoku-itto-no-ma-ai** fully ready to attack again.

_**NB**: Several different ways of Motodachi offering target can be practiced:_

1. _Open immediately after kakarite makes pressure \(seme\)_
2. _Keep relaxed kamae, and kakarite will "drive" in seme to control center line and make opportunity to strike \(kizeme\)_
3. _Wait 2-3 seconds before opening Kamae - to teach sensing opportunity._
