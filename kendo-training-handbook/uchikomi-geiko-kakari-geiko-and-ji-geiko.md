# Uchikomi geiko, Kakari-geiko and Ji-geiko

## Uchikomi Hattoku \(Eight Beneftits\)

1. Good posture \(Shisei\)
2. Strong physical body, endurance
3. Strong limbs, more agility
4. Faster Waza
5. Extend breathing
6. Observe, see striking distance or opportunity \(Uchima\)
7. Powerful strikes, sharper grip \(Te-no-uchi\)
8. Remove doubt or fear, unite thoughts, spirit and strength \(Shin Ki Ryoku no itchi.\)

### Uchikomi Procedures:

* With Motodachi and Kakatite in Chudan at Issoko-itto-no-ma-ai or a little further - Kisaki just touching, express Ki-ai \("Yah!"\).
* Kakarite performs seme - step slightly forward from right foot \(Seme-ashi\)

  **NB**: Undesirable habits: insufficient Ki-ai, improper Ma-ai.

* If Motodachi feels sufficient pressure \(Ki-ai and seme\), move Kensen slightly away from the centre to allow one of the Kihon strikes \(or thrusts\)
  * If Kensen moves down or to the sides, strike Men or Tsuki. 
  * Kensen moves up, strike Kote.
  * If Motodachi‟s Shinai is thrust forward \(and up\), strike Do.
* Step forward and strike with Fumikomi: one large forward step sharply to the floor, and left foot immediately follows up, moving forward with okuriashi- 3 to 4 steps.
* Motodachi use Hiraki-ashi to move away after the strike, with Tsuki, retreat slightly with Okuri-ashi.

  **NB**: Undesirable habits: inadequate Fumikomi gait, right foot raised too high, left foot does not follow quickly or kicks up, pause between Furikaburi and Datotsu, improper Okuriashi, hips bent and body unstable.

* Datotsu: same as in Kihon: equal strength in both hands, release strength from hands immediately after strike, relax shoulders \(especially for Furikaburi\) and contain power in the lower abdomen \(Seika Tanden\)
* Follow through with Okuriashi until distance is again at Issoko-itto-no-ma-ai or to- ma, then come to Chudan and show Zanshin.

  **NB**: Undesirable habits: excess upper body strength after striking, follow through diagonally, breaking Kamae after each strike, \(i.e. pulling hands down or pushing back over head\), insufficient or excessive follow through without Zanshin.

### Uchikomi Geiko methods:

* Against a Motodachi, practice continuous Fumikomi practice: Shomen uchi, Koteuchi, Do uchi.
* Add Renzoku-waza: Kote-Men, Kote-Do, Kote-Men-Do.
* Combine the Waza in a prearranged order - Yakusoku geiko. Such as Men, kote-men, kote-do, men-hiki men, men-hiki kote, men-hiki do, men.
* Following the ideas of the Bokuto ni yoru kendo kihon waza keiko-ho, try: Men, kote, do, kote-men, harai-men, men-taiatari-hiki men.

## Kakari Geiko

Procedure:

* With strong Ki-ai shout \("Yah!"\) break Motodachi‟s kamae and step forward to striking distance, show Seme, observe Motodachi‟s response, and immediately strike appropriate point.
* Follow through quickly, and commence next Waza as soon as Ma-ai is re-established
* Use Shikake-waza only, no Oji-waza.
* Continue without pause until told to stop

Kakari Geiko may be practiced by the pair simultaneously \(Sogo-no-Kakari-geiko.\)

## Ji-Geiko

This is the general method of doing Keiko in which we can practice implementing all the kihon and waza we have learnt during the other practices. Here we learn to find opportunity, polish our techniques, and discipline our minds and bodies. We will learn our own strengths and weaknesses, which we can try to overcome.

Do not let it become your focus just to beat your opponent, and try to strike him more time than he strikes you. You should aim to practice the waza you have learnt. Learn to use seme and with strong spirit, using fluid actions in good posture, try to learn when and how you can make perfect strikes.

### Mawari-geiko

Here all members practice together, while rotating partners in a fixed direction, for a fixed length of time. Good for cultivating spirit as you face different opponents one after another.

### Hikitate-geiko

A method of instructional Keiko where the higher ranked kendoka lets the lower ranked opponent strike correctly \(without making this obvious\), so the less experience person can gain experience of success, and learn the opportunities. Poorly executed attacks may be countered. The less experienced person should try their best to try to score first, using all they know to make an opening. It has been said that you should exhaust all your energy in such a 5 minute bout. For the senior, try to act maybe a half grade higher than opponent, and handicap yourself to what waza you can use.

### Gokaku-geiko

This is Keiko between persons of almost equal skills. In this practice we treat each other as equals, even if there is a difference in ability. You must always try to do your best Kendo. Here you should concentrate on dominating the centre, and try to score the first valid strike.

### Mitori-geiko

A method where one observes the practice of another, learning their good points and reflecting on how to improve your own kendo. If injured or waiting, do this. If you cannot make training I am sure Youtube and the like will show you experienced kendoka.

## Shiai-geiko

In this type of practice, referees rate the match. Both kendoka compete as if it is a real match. This way we learn our inadequacies and faults, as well as finding our effective waza, and gaining confidence in our techniques.

When judging our own bouts we must be honest, and call our opponents successful strikes, and not cheating to gain advantage. Do not let this Keiko degenerate into a violent fight. You must maintain the correct mental attitude to do your best kendo. If you try to attack without the same basic principles you have learnt, Kamae - Seme - Kikai \(Opportunity\) - Datotsu - Zanshin, you will not achieve a valid strike. Remember Shiai is to challenge yourself and your training. If you cannot succeed there, then you have not learnt correctly.

## Shiai

Kendo is not a sport or martialart to learn to kill somebody. It is part of your life to train yourself. It is not about somebody else, it is about yourself. Kendo training is hard and strict because it means to be so and not to be something enjoyable like football or any other sports.

Winning a match is not so important. More importantly is how you achieved that; how you prepared, practised before and how you fought, controlled yourself physically and mentally in the match.

However, winning a match is still very important. You should understand now how difficult it is to get ippon against your opponent. You need to practice long and hard to be able to beat someone. Through the preparation for a competition you will learn many things and this is the reason why we have competition.

Therefore a bad result or defeat makes your preparation meaningless. Only a victory can justify your preparation. It is wrong to think that “I lost, but it was good kendo”. That is just an excuse hiding or justifying weakness.

Try to win once you compete in a shiai and after you have become able to win then talk about your ideal kendo.
