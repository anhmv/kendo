# 打ち込み稽古、掛かり稽古、次稽古

## 打ち込み八徳「うちこみはっとく」

1. Good posture
2. Strong physical body, endurance
3. Strong limbs, more agility
4. Faster 業
5. Extend breathing
6. Observe, see striking distance or opportunity \(打ち間\)
7. Powerful strikes, sharper grip \(手の内\)
8. Remove doubt or fear, unite thoughts, spirit and strength \新規両区の一致「しんきりょうくのいっち」

### 打ち込み Procedures:

* With 元立ち and 掛かり手「かかりて」 in 中段 at 一底一途の間合い「いっそこいっとのまあい」or a little further - 機先「きさき」 just touching, express 気合い \("Yah!"\).
* 掛かり手「かかりて」 performs 攻め - step slightly forward from right foot \(攻め足\)

  **NB**: Undesirable habits: insufficient 気合い, improper 間合い.

* If 元立ち feels sufficient pressure \(気合い and 攻め\), move 剣先 slightly away from the centre to allow one of the 基本 strikes \(or thrusts\)
  * If 剣先 moves down or to the sides, strike 面 or 突き. 
  * 剣先 moves up, strike 小手.
  * If 元立ち 竹刀 is thrust forward \(and up\), strike Do.
* Step forward and strike with 踏み込み「ふみこみ」: one large forward step sharply to the floor, and left foot immediately follows up, moving forward with 送り足- 3 to 4 steps.
* 元立ち use 開き足「ひらきあし」 to move away after the strike, with 突き, retreat slightly with 送り足.

  **NB**: Undesirable habits: inadequate 踏み込み「ふみこみ」 gait, right foot raised too high, left foot does not follow quickly or kicks up, pause between 振り被り「ふりかぶり」 and 打突, improper 送り足, hips bent and body unstable.

* 打突: same as in 基本: equal strength in both hands, release strength from hands immediately after strike, relax shoulders \(especially for 振り被り「ふりかぶり」\) and contain power in the lower abdomen \(成果丹田「せいかたんでん」\)
* Follow through with 送り足 until distance is again at 一底一途の間合い「いっそくいっとのまあい」 or 刀間合い, then come to 中段 and show 残心.

  **NB**: Undesirable habits: excess upper body strength after striking, follow through diagonally, breaking 鎌え after each strike, \(i.e. pulling hands down or pushing back over head\), insufficient or excessive follow through without 残心.

### 打ち込み 稽古「げいこ」 methods:

* Against a 元立ち, practice continuous 踏み込み「ふみこみ」 practice: 正面打ち、小手打ち胴打ち.
* Add 連続業「ぜんろく」: 小手面, 小手胴, 小手面胴.
* Combine the 業 in a prearranged order - 約束稽古「やくそくげいこ」. Such as 面, 小手面, 小手胴, 面引き 面, 面引き 小手, 面引き do, 面.
* Following the ideas of the 木刀に夜剣道基本業稽古方, try: 面, 小手, do, 小手面, 払い面, 面体当たり引き面.

## 掛かり稽古「かかりげいこ」

Procedure:

* With strong 気合い shout \("Yah!"\) break 元立ち 鎌え and step forward to striking distance, show 攻め, observe 元立ち‟s response, and immediately strike appropriate point.
* Follow through quickly, and commence next 業 as soon as 間合い is re-established
* Use 仕掛け業「しかけわざ」 only, no 応じ技.
* Continue without pause until told to stop

掛かり稽古「かありげいこ」 may be practiced by the pair simultaneously \(祖語の掛かり稽古「そごのかかりげいこ」.\)

## 次稽古「じげいこ」

This is the general method of doing 稽古 in which we can practice implementing all the 基本 and 業 we have learnt during the other practices. Here we learn to find opportunity, polish our techniques, and discipline our minds and bodies. We will learn our own strengths and weaknesses, which we can try to overcome.

Do not let it become your focus just to beat your opponent, and try to strike him more time than he strikes you. You should aim to practice the 業 you have learnt. Learn to use 攻め and with strong spirit, using fluid actions in good posture, try to learn when and how you can make perfect strikes.

### 回稽古「まわりげいこ」

All members practice together, while rotating partners in a fixed direction, for a fixed length of time. Good for cultivating spirit as you face different opponents one after another.

### 引き立て稽古「ひきたてげいこ」

A method of instructional Keiko where the higher ranked 剣道家 lets the lower ranked opponent strike correctly \(without making this obvious\), so the less experience person can gain experience of success, and learn the opportunities. Poorly executed attacks may be countered. The less experienced person should try their best to try to score first, using all they know to make an opening. It has been said that you should exhaust all your energy in such a 5 minute bout. For the senior, try to act maybe a half grade higher than opponent, and handicap yourself to what 業 you can use.

### 互角稽古「ごかくげいこ」

This is Keiko between persons of almost equal skills. In this practice we treat each other as equals, even if there is a difference in ability. You must always try to do your best 剣道. Here you should concentrate on dominating the centre, and try to score the first valid strike.

### 見取稽古「みとりげいこ」

A method where one observes the practice of another, learning their good points and reflecting on how to improve your own 剣道. If injured or waiting, do this. If you cannot make training I am sure Youtube and the like will show you experienced 剣道家.

## 試合と稽古

In this type of practice, referees rate the match. Both 剣道家 compete as if it is a real match. This way we learn our inadequacies and faults, as well as finding our effective 業, and gaining confidence in our techniques.

When judging our own bouts we must be honest, and call our opponents successful strikes, and not cheating to gain advantage. Do not let this Keiko degenerate into a violent fight. You must maintain the correct mental attitude to do your best 剣道. If you try to attack without the same basic principles you have learnt, 鎌え - 攻め - 機会 - 打突 - 残心, you will not achieve a valid strike. Remember 試合「しあい」 is to challenge yourself and your training. If you cannot succeed there, then you have not learnt correctly.

## 試合「しあい」

剣道 is not a sport or martial art to learn to kill somebody. It is part of your life to train yourself. It is not about somebody else, it is about yourself. 剣道 training is hard and strict because it means to be so and not to be something enjoyable like football or any other sports.

Winning a match is not so important. More importantly is how you achieved that; how you prepared, practiced before and how you fought, controlled yourself physically and mentally in the match.

However, winning a match is still very important. You should understand now how difficult it is to get 一本 against your opponent. You need to practice long and hard to be able to beat someone. Through the preparation for a competition you will learn many things and this is the reason why we have competition.

Therefore a bad result or defeat makes your preparation meaningless. Only a victory can justify your preparation. It is wrong to think that “I lost, but it was good 剣道”. That is just an excuse hiding or justifying weakness.

Try to win once you compete in a 試合「しあい」 and after you have become able to win then talk about your ideal 剣道.
