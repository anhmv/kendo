# 何は剣道

剣道 is a traditional Japanese martial art, as well as athletic sport. How do you think of and practice it will change and develop over the time to practice the art. This guide is a summary of my understandings, and so, as a disclaimer, I cannot guarantee that these are thoughts of everyone, including myself in future times.

Over the years I have practiced 剣道, I have learnt and been taught many ideas, in many ways. I have, from the advice I have received and ideas taught to me, compiled my notes, and have selected those ideas I found most useful myself, and that were a common idea among many 先生「せんせい」. To avoid changing ideas beyond those of 剣道, I have set the basic standard as that described in the All Japanese 剣道 Federation manuals.

Where differences appear in teaching idea, I have commented in _Italic_ to give some guidance.

I set the basic elements needed for practice to master basic 剣道, and teach the skills needed to face an opponent, these begin the 基本動作「きほんどうさ」 as described by the 全日本剣道連盟「ぜんにほんけんどうれんめい」.
