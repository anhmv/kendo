# 攻め, 戦と機会「きかい」

It is the achieving of the perfect strike which is the goal of Kendo. All the previous practices teach our bodies how to move correctly. When we face our opponent in perfect 構え, we will be in a deadlock. Breaking this deadlock, by pressing and probing for weakness, is known as 責め合い「せめあい」. While taking the initiative to attack \(戦), we must also be able to detect or make an opportunity to strike \(機会「きかい」\) before we select a technique to make the valid strike. It is said that without the struggle to break the deadlock by taking the initiate, it is not Kendo, but mere "slapping for points".

## 攻め

This complex idea is critical to learning Kendo. 攻め is described as taking the initiative to close the distance with the opponent with full spirit. This puts the opponent of balance mentally and physically.

Basically it is the process of searching for a way to break the deadlock of 構え, and putting yourself in an advantageous position where you produce an opportunity to make a valid strike.

There is a say in Kendo "Win then strike; do not strike to win" - it is 攻め where we must win before we strike.

## 三叉っぽ「さんさっぽ」

三叉っぽ「さんさっぽ」is the teaching of the three ways to overwhelm an opponent. Everyone's Kendo differs due to their physical build and personality, and the kind of defense and attack methods developed are almost unlimited. However, they can be grouped together in 3 ways to unbalance and overwhelm your opponent.

1. 気を殺す「きをころす」- Killing the spirit \(気\) - use your own spirit and force of will \(気\) to overcome your opponents 気. With strong spirit they may feel fear, doubt or surprise, forestalling their attack and leading to a weakness or opportunity to strike.
2. 剣を殺す「けんをころす」- Killing the sword - spoil the opponents 構え. Control the opponent's 剣先 by restraining or deflecting it. If you direct your 剣先 to the center of your opponent's body, you will exert control over their actions.
3. 業を殺す「わざをころす」- Killing the technique. - By anticipating opponents attack, you can disrupt it and make it ineffective. As they attack, sweep it aside and counter attack, or be in a position where they are unable to strike.

## Sen - the initiative

Sen can be defined as initiative, advantage, and ambition. When facing an opponent in Kendo, we must constantly strive to seize the initiative. When one has sen \(the initiative\) one defeats the opponent. There are said to be three sen within sen. In relation to the opponent these are before, during, and after sen.

There a different names and descriptions given to them, such as sen-sen-no-sen, sen-no-sen, go-no-sen or as Musashi used in his book 五輪の賞「ごりんのしょう」, 剣の戦「けんのせん」, 大体の戦「たいたいのせん」. I have used the terms listed by the All Japan Kendo Federation.

### Mitsu-no-sen

In kendo it is of paramount importance to suppress the opponent's movement at the moment it begins. It may be said that the competition to take sen decides the match. There are said to be three sen:

1. Sen-sen-no-sen - \(The before sen\) when facing an opponent, having keen insight to quickly recognize their start, attack immediately, forestalling opponents move. This act of attacking faster than opponent's sen is the most important in kendo. This is the initiative of the pre-emptive strike 出ばな業.
2. Sen-no-sen \(sen-zen-no-sen\) - When the opponent starts an attack, win by striking him before their attack is complete.
3. Go-no-sen \(the after\) - When the opponent see 隙「すき」 \(weakness\) and initiates an attack, win by striking down or parrying attack, and counter attack when opponent is discourage.

## 機会「きかい」

This is a good opportunity. The best moments to strike are called 打突の刻「だとつのこく」. These are said to be when:

打突の刻「だとつのこく」:

* Opponent begins to strike
* Opponent blocks a strike
* Opponent finishes a strike or moves back.

It can be said that these are the three great opportunities that cannot be missed. It is important to practice recognizing these situations.

There are moments that are said to occur unfailingly during the course of combat where opportunities occur:

1. Avoid their strengths, strike where and when they are weakest.
   * Strike openings when they appear, but do not be tricked by feints of weakness.
   * Control opponent, take an advantageous 間合い, and strike them when they are immobile or move backwards. \(一本打ちの業「いっぽんうちのわざ」、飛び込みの業「とびこみのわざ」)
2. Harass them and strike.
   * Aggressively probe opponent's 構え and strike at resultant movements.
   * Attack relentlessly and strike at openings. \(二三段の技「にさんだんのわざ」)
3. Strike them when they move to attack.
   * Discern your opponent has decided to attack, as their 気 is about to take form, and strike them first. \(出ばなの業「でばなのわざ」).
4. Strike them at the moment of his attack.
   * Fein weakness, and invite them to attack
   * Strike at the unbalanced part of their attack. \(抜き業「にきわざ」、擦り上げの業「すりあげのわざ」)
   * Wait until they think of success, then counter and strike. \(擦り上げの業「すりあげのわざ」, 返し技「かえしわざ」)
5. Strike them when they are confused.
   * Strike when your opponent when they are beset with doubts and unable to decide on action.
   * Confuse them and strike. \(担ぎ業「かつぎわざ」)
6. Strike them when they stop.
   * Strike opponent when their attacks comes to an end.
   * Strike when psychological, physical and technical impetus of them as ended. \(撃ち落とし業「うちおとしわざ」)

This is the idea of taking the initiative \(sen\) by use of 攻め to find the opportunity \(機会「きかい」\) to perform technique \(業).

## Basic 攻め techniques

* The saying "win then strike; do not strike to win" emphasizes the importance of gaining superiority over the opponent before striking.
* 攻め is a way to overcome opponent's strong 気合い and 剣先.
* Breaking the opponent's 気合い and 構え creates opportunity to strike.
* As soon as 攻め defeats the opponent's 剣先, you must strike without hesitation.
* Basic practice is done with 竹刀 or 木刀; applications are practiced later with 防具「ぼうぐ」.

## Kesen and opportunity

When is 中段の構え, the 剣先 is directed towards the throat, this exerts pressure on opponents, preventing them attacking. If the 剣先 moves there is a chance to strike.

* 剣先 moves too far to the sides, or is too low, and then Men and 突き become open.
* 剣先 is raised to high - 小手 becomes open.
* Hands and arms raised to high - 胴 become open.

These above points also apply to how 攻め and 振り被り「ふりかぶり」are performed - if you move your 剣先 away from center before moving into attack, you will give opportunity away. Ways to deflecting the 剣先.

When opponent obligingly offers an open target, simply proceed with one on the basic strikes or thrust. If however, he has assumed a stable 構え, you must break it before striking.

1. 触れる「ふれる」 \(touch\): lightly touch 剣先 from right or left side without moving the position of your left grip. Feel how the opponent responds, you may raise doubt or concern in opponent's mind and induce a reaction.
2. 抑える「おさえる」 \(hold down or suppress\): push down or lightly cover opponent's 竹刀 with your left or right side of 剣先 \(凌ぎ「しのぎ」\) as opponent is about to move or strike, then strike as soon as opportunity arises.
3. 弾く「はりく」 \(knock away\): using a wrist snap or slap, knock opponent's 竹刀 to the left or right side, thus destroying their 剣先's center position.
4. 払い落とし「はらいおとし」(slap down\): when opponent's 剣先 is in a lower position, hit down \(diagonally\) their 竹刀 with a quick sharp action. Be aware that during the slap down, your own 剣先 will reveal a 隙「すき」 \(weakness\).
5. 払い上げる「はらいあげる」(deflect upward\): when 剣先 in high position or is lightly held, deflect it diagonally up. Use your snap and semi-circular motion to hold the center \(Beware of opponent's 竹刀 returning with momentum.\)
6. 巻く「まく」\(win round\): when someone holding the 竹刀 tightly, keeping the 竹刀's close, wind your 竹刀 around opponents 竹刀 close to their 唾「つば」from the right of left side. You can force their 剣先 diagonally up or down to break their 構え.

When performing the above actions you must make sure you follow these rules.

* Use your body during 攻め not just your hands - the above actions should include the use of 攻め-足 \(see chapter 4\) to press with whole body.
* Use your 物内 to strike or knock their 竹刀 close to its center.
* You must dominate the center position. During any push or slap, your 剣先 must return immediately to the center.
* Have strong spirit and determination. Make actions powerful and strike at any opening immediately.
* Do not push hands forward during 攻め - the left fist must maintain its position to allow correct 振り被り「ふりかぶり」, and the right arm must remain relaxed - as mentioned already, use your body. Hold your breath in your 丹田「たんでん」, hold the 気 in place with an unyielding left fist.

## 気-zeme

Senselessly "batting" around your opponent's 竹刀 using your wrist will only induce weakness \(隙「すき」\) in your own position, even if you are moving forward. Even though the above techniques have their place, a strong 構え and power body movement should form the root of all 攻め.

* Take the initiative with your 気.
* Dominate the center
* Control the 間合い to your advantage.

1. 気: do not let your opponent 気 gain form. bottle up or frustrate his spirit and exploit their immobility. Hold the breath in your 丹田, don't allow hands to rise, hold your 気 in with an unyielding left fist. Feel the 気 flow from your belly through the 竹刀 and 剣先 into your opponent's center. Try to develop 気暗い「きぐらい」.
2. Dominate the center: without moving your hands aim your 剣先 at your opponent's center. I have been told different ideas \(攻め to body\) - focus the 剣先 towards the throat \(突き\), chest \(left or right breast\) or sternum. The fundamental idea though is to dominate the center and the aim is that this will cause your 竹刀 to force opponent's 剣先 away from the center. leaving an opening.
3. 間合い: You must break into opponent's space and break down their 構え. You must position yourself at your 打ち間, but do not raise your 剣先 too soon or you will loose the center. Have the feeling of closing inside their 竹刀 and 間合い before striking.

**NB**: 気暗い - the strength or commanding presence derived from confidence acquired through repeated training.

## Practice applications of 攻め

I have used the term "攻め to" for these exercises. This refers to the focus of the 剣先. As discussed already, DO NOT push hands forward toward target, as this will stop correct 振り被り「ふりかぶり」 - instead use 攻め足 the the left hand to control 剣先.

* 攻め to 突き - then strike Men or 小手 depending on response
* 攻め to Men - then strike 小手 or 胴 according to response.
* 攻め to 小手, then strike Men.
* Opponent retreats: use 追い込み面「おいこみめん」\(chasing up opponent\) or 連続業「ぜんろくわざ」(such as 小手-men\)
* Opponent advanced to strike: use 出ばな or 払い業「はらいわざ」

## Ken Tai Ichi - Attack and waiting \(defense\) as one

In this saying, Ken means to attack or strike opponent fiercely to strike the first blow, and Tai means to wait resisting making the first move, while observing opponents movements calmly ready to counter attack.

In Kendo it is the direct attack that is valued most. We are all taught we should attack with "捨て身「すてみ」 - giving our all", not thinking of receiving or dodging, but only of striking. This does not mean it is right to attack recklessly when there is no opportunity, and in fact over attacking is a weakness that can be used to strike us.

Offense and defense are inseparably combined. You must attack when one should attack, and wait when one should wait. While attacking one also watches and waits. While waiting and watching one is on the verge of attacking.

* Have a posture of Ken with the body. Advance the body ready to strike at any time.
* Have an attitude of Tai with the sword. Entice the opponent to attack and counter it at the first opportunity.
* The mind should retain an attitude of Tai, as it is not good to race in. You must be calm and able to discern the correct opportunity to strike.
