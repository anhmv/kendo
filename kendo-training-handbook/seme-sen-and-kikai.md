# Seme, Sen and Kikai

It is the achieving of the perfect strike which is the goal of Kendo. All the previous practices teach our bodies how to move correctly. When we face our opponent in perfect Kamae, we will be in a deadlock. Breaking this deadlock, by pressing and probing for weakness, is known as Seme-ai. While taking the initiative to attack \(sen\), we must also be able to detect or make an opportunity to strike \(kikai\) before we select a technique to make the valid strike. It is said that without the struggle to break the deadlock by taking the initiate, it is not Kendo, but mere "slapping for points".

## Seme

This complex idea is critical to learning Kendo. Seme is described as taking the initiative to close the distance with the opponent with full spirit. This puts the opponent off balance meantally and physically.

Basiclly it is the process of searching for a way to break the deadlock of kamae, and putting yourself in an advantageous position where you produce an opportunity to make a valid strike.

There is a say in Kendo "Win then strike; do not strike to win" - it is seme where we must win before we strike.

## San-sappo. \(Mitsu no Kujiki\)

San-sappo is the teaching of the three ways to overwhelm an opponent. Everyone's Kendo differs due to their physical build and personality, and the kind of defense and attack methods developed are almost unlimited. However, they can be grouped together in 3 ways to unbalance and overwhelm your opponent.

1. Ki-wo-korosu - Killing the spirit \(ki\) - use your own spirit and force of will \(ki\) to overcome your opponents Ki. With strong spirit they may feel fear, doubt or surprise, forestalling their attack and leading to a weakness or opportunity to strike.
2. Ken-wo-korosu - Killing the sword - spoil the opponents kamae. Control the opponent's kensen by restraining or deflecting it. If you direct your kensen to the center of your opponent's body, you will exert control over their actions.
3. Waza-wo-korosu - Killing the technique. - By anticipating opponents attack, you can disrupt it and make it ineffective. As they attack, sweep it aside and counter attack, or be in a position where they are unable to strike.

## Sen - the initiative

Sen can be defined as initiative, advantage, and ambition. When facing an opponent in Kendo, we must constantly strive to seize the initiative. When one has sen \(the initiative\) one defeats the opponent. There are said to be three sen within sen. In relation to the opponent these are before, during, and after sen.

There a different names and descriptions given to them, such as sen-sen-no-sen, sen-no-sen, go-no-sen or as Musashi used in his book. go-rin-no-sho, ken-no-sen, tai-tai-no-sen. I have used the terms listed by the All Japan Kendo Federation.

### Mitsu-no-sen

In kendo it is of paramount importance to suppress the opponent's movement at the moment it begins. It may be said that the competition to take sen decides the match. There are said to be three sen:

1. Sen-sen-no-sen - \(The before sen\) when facing an opponent, having keen insight to quickly recognize their start, attack immediately, forestalling opponents move. This act of attacking faster than opponent's sen is the most important in kendo. This is the initiative of the pre-emptive strike debana-waza.
2. Sen-no-sen \(sen-zen-no-sen\) - When the opponent starts an attack, win by striking him before their attack is complete.
3. Go-no-sen \(the after\) - When the opponent see suki \(weakness\) and initiates an attack, win by striking down or parrying attack, and counter attack when opponent is discourage.

## Kikai

This is a good opportunity. The best moments to strike are called datotu-no-koki. These are said to be when:

**Datotsu-no-koki**:

* Opponent begins to strike
* Opponent blocks a strike
* Opponent finishes a strike or moves back.

It can be said that these are the three great opportunities that cannot be missed. It is important to practice recognizing these situations.

There are moments that are said to occur unfailingly during the course of combat where opportunities occur:

1. Avoid their strengths, strike where and when they are weakest.
   * Strike openings when they appear, but do not be tricked by feints of weakness.
   * Control opponent, take an advantageous maai, and strike them when they are immobile or move backwards. \(Ippon uchi no waza, tobikomi-waza\)
2. Harass them and strike.
   * Aggressively probe opponent's kamae and strike at resultant movements.
   * Attack relentlessly and strike at openings. \(Ni-san-dan-no-waza\)
3. Strike them when they move to attack.
   * Discern your opponent has decided to attack, as their Ki is about to take form, and strike them first. \(Debana-waza\).
4. Strike them at the moment of his attack.
   * Fein weakness, and invite them to attack
   * Strike at the unbalanced part of their attack. \(Nuki-waza, suriage-waza\)
   * Wait until they think of success, then counter and strike. \(Nuki-waza, kaeshi-waza\)
5. Strike them when they are confused.
   * Strike when you ropponent when they are beset with doubts and unable to decide on action.
   * Confuse them and strike. \(Katsugi-waza\)
6. Strike them when they stop.
   * Strike opponent when their attacks comes to an end.
   * Strike when their psychological, physical and technical impetus as ended. \(Uchiotoshi-waza\)

This is the idea of taking the initiative \(sen\) by use of seme to find the opportunity \(kikai\) to perform technique \(waza\).

## Basic seme techniques

* The saying "win then strike; do not strike to win" emphasizes the importance of gaining superiority over the opponent before striking.
* Seme is a way to overcome opponent's strong ki-ai and kensen.
* Breaking the opponent's ki-ai and kamae creates opportunity to strike.
* As soon as seme defeats the oppoent's kensen, you must strike without hesitation.
* Basic practice is done with shinai or bokuto; applications are practiced later with bogu.

## Kesen and opportunity

When is chudan-no-kamae, the kensen is directed towards the throat, this exerts pressure on opponents, preventing them attacking. If the kensen moves there is a chance to strike.

* Kensen moves to far to the sides, or is to low, and then Men and Tsuki become open.
* Kensen is raised to high - Kote becomes open.
* Hands and arms raised to high - Dou become open.

These above points also apply to how seme and furi-kaburi are performed - if you move your kensen away from center before moving into attack, you will give opportunity away. Ways to deflecting the Kensen.

When opponent obligingly offers an open target, simply proceed with one on the basic strikes or thrust. If however, he has assumed a stable kamae, you must break it before striking.

1. Fureru \(touch\): lightly touch kensen from right or left side without moving the position of your left grip. Feel how the opponent responds, you may raise doubt or concern in opponent's mind and induce a reaction.
2. Osaeru \(hold down or suppress\): push down or lightly cover opponent's shinai with your left or right side of kensen \(shinogi\) as opponent is about to move or strike, then strike as soon as opportunity arises.
3. Hajiku or Hari \(knock away\): using a wrist snap or slap, knock opponent's shinai to the left or right side, thus destroying their kensen's center position.
4. Harai-otoshi \(slap down\): when opponent's kensen is in a lower position, hit down \(diagonally\) their shinai with a quick sharp action. Be aware that during the slap down, your own kensen will reveal a suki \(weakness\).
5. Harai-ageru \(deflect upward\): when kensen in high position or is lightly held, deflect it diagonally up. Use your snap and semi-circular motion to hold the center \(Beware of opponent's shinai returning with mementum.\)
6. Maku \(maki-age or maki-otoshi\)\(win round\): when someone holding the shinai tightly, keeping the shinai's close, wind your shinai around opponents shinai close to their tsuba from the right of left side. You can force their kensen diagonally up or down to break their kamae.

When performing the above actions you must make sure you follow these rules.

* Use your body during seme not just your hands - the above actions should include the use of seme-ashi \(see chapter 4\) to press with whole body.
* Use your mono-uchi to strike or knock their shinai close to its center.
* You must dominate the center position. During any push or slap, your kensen must return immediately to the center.
* Have strong spirit and determination. Make actions powerful and strike at any opening immediately.
* Do not push hands forward during seme - the left fist must maintain its position to allow correct furi-kaburi, and the right arm must remain relaxed - as mentioned already, use your body. HOld your breath in your tanden, hold the ki in place with an unyielding left fist.

## Ki-zeme

Senselessly "batting" around your opponent's shinai using your wrist will only induce weakness \(suki\) in your own position, even if you are moving forward. Even though the above techniques have their place, a strong kamae and power body movement should form the root of all seme.

* Take the initiative with your Ki.
* Dominate the center
* Control the maai to your advantage.

1. Ki: do not let your opponent ki gain form. bottle up or frustrate his spirit and exploit their immobility. HOld the breath in your tanden, don't allow hands to rise, hold your ki in with an unyielding left fist. Feel the ki flow from your belly through the shinai and kensen into your opponent's center. Try to develop Ki-gurai.
2. Dominate the center: without moving your hands aim your kensen at your opponent's center. I have been told different ideas \(seme to body\) - focus the kensen towards the throat \(tsuki\), chest \(left or right breast\) or sternum. The fundamental idea though is to dominate the center and the aim is that this will cause your shinai to force opponent's kensen away from the center. leaving an opening.
3. Maai: You must break into opponent's space and break down their kamae. You must position yourself at your uchima, but do not raise your kensen to soon or you will loose the center. Have the feeling of closing inside their shinai and maai before striking.

**NB**: Ki-gurai - the strength or commanding presence derived from confidence acquired through repeated training.

## Practice applications of Seme

I have used the term "seme to" for these exercises. This refers to the focus of the kensen. As discussed already, DO NOT push hands forward toward target, as this will stop correct furi-kaburi - instead use seme-ashi the the left hand to control kensen.

* Seme to tsuki - then strike Men or Kote depending on response
* Seme to Men - then strike Kote or Dou according to response.
* Seme to Kote, then strike Men.
* Opponent retreats: use Oi-komi Men \(chasing up opponent\) or Renzoku-waza \(such as Kote-men\)
* Opponent advanced to strike: use Debana-waza or Harai-waza

## Ken Tai Ichi - Attack and waiting \(defense\) as one

In this saying, Ken means to attack or strike opponent fiercely to strike the first blow, and Tai means to wait resisting making the first move, while observing opponents movements calmly ready to counter attack.

In Kendo it is the direct attack that is valued most. We are all taught we should attack with "sutemi - giving our all", not thinking of receiving or dodging, but only of striking. This does not mean it is right to attack recklessly when there is no opportunity, and in fact over attacking is a weakness that can be used to strike us.

Offense and defense are inseparably combined. You must attack when one should attack, and wait when one should wait. While attacking one also watches and waits. While waiting and watching one is on the verge of attacking.

* Have a posture of Ken with the body. Advance the body ready to strike at any time.
* Have an attitude of Tai with the sword. Entice the opponent to attack and counter it at the first opportunity.
* The mind should retain an attitude of Tai, as it is not good to race in. You must be calm and able to discern the correct opportunity to strike.
