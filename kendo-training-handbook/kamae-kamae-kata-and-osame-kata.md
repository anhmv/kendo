# 構え、構え方、納め方

## 構え「かまえ」

構え「かまえ」is the guard, or ready posture employed for attack and defense. However, more than just a physical pose, 構え is also the on-guard posturing of the mind and spirit. These aspects of 構え「かまえ」, the body and mindset, must always be practiced together. Equally important to keep in mind is that 構え begins and ends with proper etiquette. These points are never to be overlooked.

The legendary swordsman, Miyamoto Musashi \(1584-1645\) distinguished in his writings five primary guard postures collectively termed 五行の構え「ごぎょうのかまえ」. In modern kendo, the 五行の構え continues to be the principal guard postures. The 五行の構え are 中段の構え、上段の構え、下段の構え 、 八相の構え、 and 脇構え. Of the five, 中段の構え is the first and most versatile of the guard postures. In modern 剣道, 中段の構え is the posture that the other four 構え are instigated from.

### 中段の構え「ちゅうだんのかまえ」

Left grip at the end of 柄「つか」\(handle\), in front of the navel, right hand near but not touching the 鍔「つば」\(guard\), "V" between the thumb and index finger of both hands over the top of the 柄「つか」, left grip with last three fingers hold the 竹刀, while right hand with last two fingers lightly support it, 剣先 towards the opponent's throat, 弦「つる」\(string\) is up, right foot forward, with of a foot between feet, left heel slightly off the floor, left knee straight but not locked.

### Hand position

The anatomy of the hand includes the 虎の口「とらのくち」. The 虎の口 is the angle at the base of the index finger and thumb. The 虎の口 and the 弦「つる」 or the seams of the 柄側「つかがわ」\[leather handle covering\] are the keys to positioning the hands in relation to the 竹刀 circumference. The 弦「つる」 indicates the upright side of the 竹刀 in its drawn attitude. In its correct configuration, the 弦「つる」 also marks the top center line of the 竹刀. The hands should be positioned on the 竹刀 in such a manner that the top center line of the 竹刀 runs through the apex of the 虎の口 of both hands.

![Tora no Kuchi](https://b9bexa.dm.files.1drv.com/y4mshaNARUJPK39CmyTIoKza7kReH3ftfDKzMzWonoXCL21fMGGg6DNRvipZnWdMQIKe2H7U4TtQ9xAyFO6kwIaSLs_hkyztlxvgLm5R6JOIpP4yA95dlaan-mVI27d3Vhf4Lt1EfUPsiA2S_atTB7wOcF-zgBDV5ia_Gl_p35sY3bwv_0wiAeGGyNsmwXYP-O6JP2iOZGO2XFKs0bEAxaudQ?width=876&height=616&cropmode=none)

The left hand is positioned at the end of the 柄「つか」, clasping the 柄頭「つかがしら」midway into the little finger. \[**NB**: Holding 木刀, the left hand should just reveal the 柄頭「つかがしら」\]

The forward position of the right hand is generally one-and-a-half fists ahead of the left hand. A common method for establishing the forward position of the right hand is to:

* Bend the right arm at the elbow
* Place the hilt of the 竹刀 in the joint of the elbow
* Grasp the 竹刀 with the right hand. Where the hand grasps the 竹刀 is the point of placement for the right hand.
* The right hand should almost touch the 鍔「つば」 of the 竹刀 \(more than 2cm of 柄「つか」\) means it is the wrong length and needs adjusting.

**Hand grip**

The 竹刀 should be gripped firmly, not tightly, as if holding an egg without crushing the shell. Both hands grip in a similar manner, but the left grip should be firmer than that of the right hand.

To grip the 竹刀:

* Extended the hand as if reaching out to give a handshake greeting.
* Position the hilt of the 竹刀 on the inside portion of the heel of the hand.
* Grasp the 竹刀 firmly with the little and ring fingers.
* Grip the 竹刀 with the middle finger using moderate \(not tight or loose\) pressure.
* The index finger and thumb remain relaxed.
* The right hand is positioned appropriately on the 竹刀, as previously outlined, and grips the 竹刀 in the same manner as the left hand, with slightly less pressure.

**Main points**:

1. Throughout the process of strikes and techniques, the hand positioning and grip should never change.
2. The hands should not grip the 竹刀 squarely. A square grip is usually the result of including the index fingers and thumbs in gripping the 竹刀. Such a grip will restrict the flexibility and movement of the hands.
3. The hilt of the 竹刀 should be held at the very end. The overlapping of the small finger halfway over the end of the 竹刀 is an acceptable practice. However, never is the 竹刀 to be held with the hilt protruding from the heel of the left hand. \[**NB**: Holding a 木刀, the left hand should just reveal the 柄頭「つかがしら」\]
4. The right hand should not grasp the 竹刀 directly below the 鍔「つば」.

In 中段の構え, the 竹刀 held in the centre-plane of the body with the tip projecting forward to the opponent. Below, details the correct positioning of the hands and 竹刀 in relation to the body and the opponent.

1. The left hand is extended approximately the with of one fist \(10cm\) forward of the abdomen.
2. The first joint of the thumb \(at the base of the thumb\) is in a direct line in front of the navel.
3. The 竹刀 is angled forward, 弦「つる」 \(cord\) upwards, projecting the line of the 竹刀 to the opponent's throat, face or left eye.
4. The elbows should not stick out, but be relaxed, with a slight between them and the body - they would just touch your **do** lightly. Have the feeling of holding an egg in each armpit.

**NB**: The height of the 剣先 can vary in certain instances, but should not be higher than your opponent's throat or lower than his Kote. It must also remain close to the centre, always pointing within opponent's body/throat area. To quote the **All Japan Kendo Federation Dictionary**: "... the extension of the 剣先 \(tip of the 竹刀\) points between the opponent's eyes". However they also add within there "基本方" text "From 一足一刀の間合い「いっそくいっとうのまあい」\(one-step one-strike interval\) the line of the 剣先 should extend to a point on the face between the eyes or towards the left-eye." However in the Fundamental Kendo manual, and Nippon Kendo Kata text they state that the 竹刀 or 木刀 "... is held so that the tip \(鋒「きっさき」\) points toward the opponent's throat."

_The projected line of the 竹刀 is called the "劍先." However more than just a noun for a positional reference, 劍先 includes functional principles. The understanding and application of 劍先 is the key in maneuvering, attacking, and forestalling an opponent. this aspect is presented here as an introduction, only. The concept and the actual application can only be acquired through diligent training._

_If the 劍先 drops to low, the 竹刀 becomes vulnerable to being struck down, giving the opportunity to strike 面 using Hari-otoshi or 小手-面「こてめん」, If the 劍先 rises to point above the head, it no longer exerts pressure on opponent, and is also an opportunity to strike 小手._

_Keeping the 劍先 at a level where the opponent can only see its tip seems to about the correct level. This provides a threat to opponent, requiring the displacement of the 劍先 to make an opportunity. From this position, pushing hands or body forwards, the 竹刀 tip should strike the 喉\(throat\), as in 付 attack._

### Foot position

As noted in the coming section, 足捌き「あしさばき」, footwork is the most important aspect in 剣道 practice. Good footwork begins with correct foot positioning.

In their correct position, the feet are separated by approximately the width of one fist \(10cm\) with the toes pointed directly forward. The heel of the right foot should be aligned with the big toe of the left foot. The heel of the right foot should be resting lightly on the floor while the heel of the left foot should be elevated to a natural height off of the floor. The body weight is centered between the feet with the strength of mobility focused in the lower part of the legs from the knees downward. The upper body, form the knees upward, remains relaxed. While the left leg should remain straight, the knee must not be locked. The position of the left foot / leg is vital.

![Ashi sabaki](https://b9apxa.dm.files.1drv.com/y4mXSNWp9Ts12hpZdXNEBSEE332XE16zVFflDXu0NfThHpIe8QV3q6eYahsKDSWLCMIiQj30JGUEMHQ0X_-DIferVxc1SDY-B3dvEfYv1i9RIjZdLfXUNFMjLsc0myD8S5piTXoR0a2tDuws_TQKWMdblshFt1edaw9jbn4xXdIym5OPeSUSMOMRiwKWpTjC5RY6-Wi-oqfke8APzewMZhYGg?width=1048&height=598&cropmode=none)

There are two common methods used to aid in foot positioning.

1. The first methods starts from 自然体 with the heels of the feet together and the toes pointed 30 degrees outward. Pivot on the balls of the feet and rotate the heels outward to point the toes directly forward. Step forward with the right foot to a point where the heel is aligned with the big toe of the left foot.
2. In the second method, the right foot is positioned with the toes pointed directly forward. The heel of the left foot is placed against the heel of the right foot with the toes pointed 90 degrees outward \(to the left\). From this position, pivot the heel of the left foot outward to point the toes directly forward. The feet should now be in their correct position.

By taking a natural step forward and halting mid-step \(so right heel in line with left toes\) the left heel will naturally raise, and with the weight evenly \(50:50\) distributed on both fee, you should naturally take correct posture.

**Conditions to avoid**:

* The toes should not point outward. Such a stance may seem stable; however, it is unstable when moving backward and **fumikiri** \(push off the rear leg\) is slow and weak. Toes should point forwards towards your opponent.
* Avoid a stance where the feet are in a line. this is an unstanble stance and movement in any direction is difficult.
* Do not position the feet closer together than prescribed. This foot position may have some benefit in forward and backward movements, but is unstable. It is also weak when receiving an opponent's 体当たり \( body check\)
* When the feet are extended too far apart in their forward-back relation, movement in all directions becomes awkward. Additionally, such a stance lowers the body height and allows an opponent to dominate in stature.

![Incorrect Foot work](https://b9bbxa.dm.files.1drv.com/y4mByMwyJrjkgBmBJJAbQEKxU9O2lX62o3bJwsAq98-WFftup6Mu1AOiDLVKB9xiOEXtBteYtG1KQ73d1goQc8gl0G2q-SbKrpzNBIeJ08wO9YVjn1nEv-1CrOVYzrR6TtS9wfSJVYS2JxPpuqjWAv7RCUlXtgYJVxbhsrqfBkEynY5e4UehnZm85uJ22-x_5AGE9tuIKP1ZL6Kkf1JEf3QyQ?width=1110&height=378&cropmode=none)

**Hip position**:

Hip should be kept square to the front, with the buttocks tucked in. This allows the left leg/foot to be positioned correctly. When pushing or lunging forwards, your body will then keep straight. This also helps the left foot to quickly return to its position behind the right foot. It is essential to provide a stable and balanced platform to allow correct striking.

### 目付「めつけ」

* 目付 is the positioning of one's eyes. It is the act of observing the opponents whole, while looking into his eyes. Some kendo sayings used to try explain the feeling are:
* 遠山の目付「えんざんのめつけ」 means that you look at your opponent as if you are looking at a far away mountain. That is too look at the opponent as a whole, rather than focusing on one point.
* 観見の目付「かんけんのめつけ」is the teaching of the importance of having a keen eye which can not only see the opponent's appearance, but can also perceive the opponents abilities, state of mind and intentions. \(Read Gorin no Sho by Miyamoto Musashi for more details.\)

These ideas are all very deep, and require study. To begin with:

* Watch the eyes: opponent looking at the target before striking \(don't get tricked\)
* Watch the 劍先 and wrists \(especially right 小手\) to spot initiation of technique.
* Watch the shoulders. As they breathe out is a good time to attack them.
* Watch oneself - check your own position for weakness.

### Assuming 構え \(with 竹刀\)

* Stand in 自然体「しぜんたい」 with the 竹刀 held in 提げ刀「さげとう」.

提げ刀: the holding of the 竹刀 in a relaxed attitude while standing in shizen-tai. The sinai is held naturally at the side with the hilt angled slightly inward. Viewed from the side, the 竹刀 should be held at a 45-degree angle. The tsuru of the 竹刀 is positioned on the downward side.

* Execute 目礼「もくれい」. Keep the grasp of the 竹刀 relaxed and do not change the position or angle of the 竹刀 as the bow is performed. Ask your partner to please train お願いします.
* Raise the 竹刀 to the 体刀「たいとう」 position.

体刀: the standing posture with the 竹刀 held in a drawing attitude. From 提げ刀「さげとう」, the 竹刀 is raised to the hip with the hilt of the 竹刀 directly forward of the bellybutton. The pad of the thumb is placed on the 鍔「つば」, slightly to the inside \(right\) fro the center of the 竹刀.

* Draw the 竹刀 - "抜け刀「ぬけとう」"

抜け刀「ぬけとう」: push out your 竹刀 a little forward and start drawing your 竹刀 towards your opponent. At the same time, take a small step forward onto the right foot.

\*When drawing the 竹刀 with the right hand, the left hand stays still.

\*Flip your sword forward in a large arc to the front, and grab the 竹刀 with the left hand.

When you stop here, you are ready to go in the 中段 position.

* Assume the そんきょ position.

そんきょ: turn in your left heel, and bend at the knees to lơer the hips. そんきょ is a posture taken to show respect before and after a match or training evolution. When in this squatting posture, correct upper body posture is maintained. The knees are opened outward with the thighs forming a 90-degree angle. The body is balanced on the balls of the feet and the 竹刀 is held in 中段.

* Stand and take a step forward with the right foot to bright the feet into proper guard position.

### Kamae-kata: Assuming Kamae with partner \(竹刀 practice\)

1. Face each other in the 提げ刀「さげとう」 posture at a separation of nine steps.
2. Execute 立礼「りつれい」.
3. Bright the 竹刀 to the 体刀「たいとう」 position.
4. Take three steps forward starting with the right foot.
5. Draw the 竹刀, "抜け刀「ぬけとう」", on the third step and assume the そんきょ position.
6. Stand and take a step forward with the right foot to bright the feet into proper guard position.

### Osame-kata - Withdrawing from kamae

Replacing the 竹刀 is the reverse sequence

1. From the 中段の構え posture.
2. Turn in your left heel, and bend the knees and lower the hips to assume the そんきょ position.
3. Withdraw the 竹刀 - "おさまえと \(reverse nuke-to action\)" to the 体刀 position and then straighten the legs to stand.
4. Step back starting with the left foot.
5. Lower the 竹刀 to the 提げ刀「さげとう」 position.
6. Perform 目礼「もくれい」, and thank your partner ありがとうございます.

**Main points**

* Proper upper body posture should always be maintained.
* When drawing the 竹刀, grasp the 柄「つか」 from the underside so the 弦「つる」 will come to rest on the topside of the 竹刀 after the 竹刀 is drawn. Conversely, when withdrawing the 竹刀 the 竹刀 should be rotated to bring the tsuru to rest on the downward side.
* When taking そんきょ with a partner, careful consideration should be given to the distance to the center starting point - upon taking three steps and drawing the 竹刀, the 竹刀 tip should be with in the center area of the court or training floor.
* When in the そんきょ position with a partner, the tips of the 竹刀 should be separated by two to ten centimeters.

### Kamae O-toku \(normal instruction "Yasume" in 竹刀 kendo\)

Assume a relaxed or at-ease posture with the 竹刀 drawn. From 中段の構え, turn the 竹刀 downward to point the 鋒「きっさき」 to just outside the opponent's left knee. The 鋒「きっさき」 should be at a level five or six centimeters below the knee. The edge of the 竹刀 \(side opposite the 弦「つる」\) should be angled downward and to the inside at approximately 45 degrees.
