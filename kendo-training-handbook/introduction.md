# Kendo Training Handbook

Kendo is a traditional Japanese martial art, as well as Athletic sport. How do you think of and practice it will change and develop over the time to practice the art. This guide is a summary of my understandings, and so, as a disclaimer, I cannot guarantee that these are thoughts of everyone, including myself in future times.

Over the years I have practiced Kendo, I have learnt and been taught many ideas, in many ways. I have, from the advice I have received and ideas taught to me, compiled my notes, and have selected those ideas I found most useful myself, and that were a common idea among many Sensei. To avoid changing ideas beyond those of Kendo, I have set the basic standard as that described in the All Japanese Kendo Federation manuals.

Where differences appear in teaching idea, I have commented in _Italic_ to give some guidance.

I set the basic elements needed for practice to master basic Kendo, and teach the skills needed to face an opponent, these begin the 基本動作「きほんどうさ」 as described by the 全日本剣道連盟「ぜんにほんけんどうれんめい」.

## **基本動作「きほんどうさ」**

1. 姿勢「しせい」: Posture
2. 構え「かまえ」: Stance or posture
3. 目付「めつけ」: Use of eyes
4. 構え方「かまえかた」: The way of drawing the bokuto/shinai
5. 収め方「おさめかた」: The way of putting away bokuto/shinai
6. 足捌き「あしさばき」: Foot work
7. 素振り「すぶり」: Swinging the shinai
8. 掛け声「かけごえ」: Vocalization
9. 間合い「まあい」: Distance between oneself and opponent
10. 基本の打ち方「きほんのうちかた」, 突き方「つきかた」, and 受け方「うけかた」: Basic ways of string, thrusting and receiving strikes
11. 切り返し「きりかえし」: Continuous striking center, right-left men
12. 体当たり「たいあたり」: Colliding with opponent
13. つばぜらい「つばぜらい」: Fighting close with the sword guards.
14. 残心「ざんしん」: Keeping alert with correct posture after cutting

I have adjusted the order to fit in with the logical progression of practice and contents of this list to include notes on 礼儀作法「れいぎさほう」 \(Etiquette and Manners\).
