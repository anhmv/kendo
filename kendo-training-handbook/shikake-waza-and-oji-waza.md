# 仕掛け技と応じ技

剣道 techniques \(技\) are usually group into two categories:

1. 仕掛け技: techniques for initiating an attack. These positive attacking techniques are used to challenge and forestall the opponent, gaining the center, and thus an opportunity.
2. 応じ技: techniques where you avoid or parry opponent's strike and counter attack at the resulting weakness. It is commonly said that in 剣道 we never defend for the sake of defense, but as a way of striking ourselves. 応じ means response, but we cannot wait to be attacked. We should still probe our opponent's 構え, leading with our 気, to force their attack which we can use to generate an opportunity to strike.

The situation is not however so clear cut. Rather like the idea of ying and yang, these ideas have to be balance, and merge into one another. What may start as 仕掛け技 may end as 応じ技. An example here is to initiate the attack with 払い技 but you are countered by 出ばな技 - you then counter and strike with the same action, but this is now 擦り上げ技. Only by constant training can we hope to react correctly.

You should be able to move and strike correctly as discussed in previous section. All the following assumes these previous 基本 have learnt, and that 攻め is used. These 技 are then used according to opponent's response \(see Kikai - chapter 8\).

These two categories are further divided into sub groups of similar techniques. I have only listed a few. I have made my choices based on what senior sensei most commonly teach us. and on the ideas and goals of the 木刀による 剣道 基本 技 稽古方.

I have heard different ideas with regards to the learning and use of the different 技. It is an old 剣道 dictum that says it takes three years to learn the basics. This I believe depends on the person and how much they practice, but still without the ability to perform large correct strikes, it is impossible to progress to complex techniques. However, 剣道 without 技 can become dull if you think of only striking 面. The use of the 木刀による 剣道 基本 技 稽古方 is a good way of introducing the ideas of 技. I have read that these are designed to teach students these basics of 技 by the time they reach 2nd Dan. To begin with, concentrate on 仕掛け技, taking the initiative to strike going forwards.

## 仕掛け技

### 一本 打ち no 技

These attacks are performed as the basic 基本 strikes already discussed. They sometimes go under other names, such as 飛び込み技 and 引きばな技, but these are really ways of describing the 攻め and timing. Some basic ideas and practices are:

* 面打ち: from 刀間合い, push in with full spirited 攻め to 突き. Opponent hesitates or retreats - drive forward controlling center and strike 面.
* 面打ち: from 刀間合い, push in with 攻め to 小手. Opponent drops 剣先 to cover your 竹刀 - take center and strike 面.
* 小手打ち: from 刀間合い, 攻め to 面 or 突き. Opponent raises 剣先 to defend showing a weakness - strike 小手.
* 胴打ち: from 刀間合い, push in with 攻め to 面 as if about to strike. Opponent raise 竹刀 to block revealing 胴, leap forward and strike.

### 連続技 \(二三段の技)

There are two methods of using these techniques.

1. The first attack rather than just 攻め is used to destroy opponents spirit and posture, revealing an opportunity to strike. These actions must be performed in a continuous unbroken sequence. you must strike with determination, not a mere feinting action.
2. When first attack unsuccessful, observe the change in opponent's position, respond to their movement and strikes again \(and again\) until a valid strike is made. The correct continuous rhythm must be maintained.

**NB**: In 試合「しあい」, even if first strike was a perfect 一本, it would not count if second strike was unsuccessful - keep this in mind.

* 小手-面: from 刀間合い, push in with full spirit and strike 小手. Opponent defends and retreats - pull left foot quickly up into place, drive forward and strike 面.
* 小手胴: from 刀間合い, push in with full spirit and strike 小手. Opponent avoids and anticipates 面 cut blocking while retreating or retreats while raising 竹刀 to perform 抜き技 - pull left foot quickly up into place, drive forward \(diagonally right\) and strike 胴.
* 面胴: from 刀間合い, push in with full spirit and strike 面. Opponent avoids and anticipates 面 cut blocking \(while retreating\) - pull left foot quickly up into place, drive forward \(diagonally right\) and strike 胴. \(間合い is harder - control footwork to strike with 物打ち\).
* 面-面: from 刀間合い, push in with full spirit and strike 面. Opponent anticipates strike and retreats while losing strong 構え - pull left foot quickly up into place, and strike 面. \(this is a case where opponent is trying to avoid making first strike ineffective\).

Many other combinations exist, such as 突き-面, 小手-面-胴, 面, 体当たり, 引き-面.

When practicing, keep the following in mind:

1. Begin with large striking action and body movements, where 元立ち moves back sufficiently to allow correct striking.
2. Later, use small techniques where 元立ち does not have to move to allow second strike.
3. The left foot must be drawn up immediately \(引きつけ) to allow correct striking in good posture.
4. Learn to control the size of your steps. You must move body in posture to allow striking with 物打ち.
5. Each strike must be made in full spirit.
6. Your 手の打ち must be tightened and relaxed with each strike. Correct 手の打ち is essential.
7. Perform actions in one continuous attack sequence.

### 払い技

When your opponent has a strong 中段の構え there is no chance to strike. The 剣先 must be moved away from the center to give an opportunity. This can be achieved by 払い上げ - parrying their 竹刀 diagonally upward to the left or right or 払い落とし - parrying it diagonally down to the left, controlling the center and striking immediately.

There are several key aspects that must be observed or considered to be effective:

1. You must use perform the sweeping action with your body \(moving forward\), not just your hands - sweeping with 攻め足.
2. Use both hands to parry, at the moment of parry snap your wrist to sharpen action.
3. Parry in a semi-circular motion. Your hands must move quickly forward and up along the path of 振り被り「ふりかぶり」.
4. Parry the midpoint of opponent's 竹刀 using 物打ち of your 竹刀.
5. The curved movement allows sweeping action to finish at the end of 振り被り「ふりかぶり」, and ensures 竹刀 in the correct position to strike - all in one action.
6. At the beginning, learn techniques using 摺足「すりあし」 and large techniques.
7. Later use small sweeping action and fast powerful 踏み込み「ふみこみ」.
8. The entire action must be made in one continuous action.

The timing and opportunities are also critical:

* When stationary, the 構え is strongest. You will gain great advantage performing this 技 at the moment opponent advances to attack or retreats.
* 払い上げ most effective when opponent's 剣先 higher then your own.
* 払い落とし most effective against a 剣先 lower than your own.

**NB**: You can set the level of your 剣先 as part of 攻め, i.e. to 小手, is lower position.

#### 払い面 \(表「おもて」」\)

* Push forward while sweeping up 竹刀 from lower right to upper left in semi circular action knocking 剣先 of opponent away from the center.
* Maintaining the center, immediately \(in one motion\) strike 正面.

#### 払い面 \(裏「うら」\)

* Drop 剣先 slightly, and push forward while sweeping up 竹刀 form lower left to upper right in semi circular action knocking 剣先 of opponent away from the center.
* Maintaining the center, immediately \(in one motion\) strike 正面

#### 払い小手 \(裏「うら」\)

* Drop 剣先 slightly, and push forward while sweeping up 竹刀 from lower left to upper right in semi circular action knocking 剣先 of opponent away from the center.
* Maintaining the center, immediately \(in one motion\) strike 小手. This requires quick action and small fast footwork.

#### 払い小手 \(落とし\)

* Raise 剣先 and push forward while sweeping down 竹刀 from upper right to lower left with sharp 手の打ち in a small circular action knocking 剣先 of opponent down to your left.
* Your 剣先 must return immediately to the center position, from where you can complete the strike to 正面.

Again, many other options of the 技 exist, such as 払い突き, 裏「うら」, 表「おもて」」 and 落とし.

#### Hiki-wara

There are stepping back techniques, a 技 where you strike while retreating from close quarters. These techniques are usually performed from 鍔迫り合い after a previous attack. You must first break your opponent's guard either by 体当たり or pushing opponent to off balance them and break posture.

鍔迫り合い means to fight on compete with the hand guard \(see 構え\)

* The foot work is hard to master.
* First practice using 摺足「すりあし」 and large actions then later use small fast actions and powerful footwork.
* Push with right foot/knee, body, hips and arms. But do not push arms forward or allow them to collapse inward - left fist must remain in correct position to strike.

There any many ways of breaking the 構え from 鍔迫り合い, I will discuss the basic ideas only:

**引き面**

* From 鍔迫り合い, push forward with 攻め足. Push 竹刀 inward towards body or their right shoulder.
* Wait for opponent to push back, trying to maintain their 構え
* Immediately step back from the left leg to 打ち間合い, with the feeling of pulling opponent toward you.
* Opponent should now be off balance and 剣先 will drop forward \(to your left\) giving an opportunity.
* Stamp the right foot \(踏み込み足「ふみこみあし」) while striking 面 with 気-ken-tai-ichi, and flick left foot up and back to move back showing 残心.

**NB**: 残心 - do not pull arms above the head, when retreating keep hands forward \(may be slightly raised, 剣先 point up\). Retreat about 3 steps and take 中段の構え at appropriate distance.

**Hiki-do**

* From 鍔迫り合い, press in and down with 攻め足. Push 竹刀 and hands down.
* Wait for opponent to resist, push hands back up, trying to maintain their 構え.
* Immediately step back from the left leg to 打ち間合い, with the feeling of push opponent's hands up as you swing up.
* Opponent's arm will rise
* Rotate wrist and strike the 胴 while stamping the right foot \(踏み込み足「ふみこみあし」) and flick left foot up and back to move back showing 残心.

**NB**: 残心 - do not pull arms back when retreating, keep hands forward in striking position \(may be slightly raised, 剣先 point up\). Retreat about 3 steps and take 中段の構え at appropriate distance.

**引き小手**

* From 鍔迫り合い, push forward and down with 攻め足. Push 竹刀 inward towards body as if trying to touch the neck of opponent.
* Wait for opponent to push back, trying to maintain their 構え
* Immediately step diagonally back to the left, starting from the left leg, to 打ち間合い, maybe have feeling of flicking left hand up beneath opponent's hand.
* Opponent should now be off balance and 剣先 will rise, giving an opportunity.
* Stamp the right foot \(踏み込み足「ふみこみあし」) while striking a straight 小手 with 気剣体一致, and flick left foot and back to move back showing 残心.

**NB**: 残心 - do not pull arms back when retreating, keep hands forward in striking position \(may be slightly raised, 剣先 point up\). Retreat about 3 steps and take 中段の構え at appropriate distance.

You can practice this 技 in many different ways:

* From 鍔迫り合い, compete to find opening and strike. 元立ち should follow up to help develop speed of your footwork and 残心.
* Strike opponent, then both performs 体当たり, and 掛かり手 will strike with 引き技
* Strike opponent. 元立ち will "block" strike - both perform 体当たり, and 掛かり手 will strike with 引き技
* Strike opponent. 元立ち will "block" strike and move aside, and 掛かり手 turns as they pass and will strike again with 引き技
* 元立ち strike \(面\) - you block attack using correct 受け方, and immediately use 引き技 to strike them.

#### 出ばな技

Just as the opponent moves toward you on the verge of striking, they are likely to be concentrating on their own technique, loosing sight of your actions, thus presenting you with a good opportunity to strike.

You must strike at first sign of their intentions to attack. if you wait for 剣先 to left, you have already missed the chance.

**出ばな面**

* From 刀間合い, push in with 攻め足 to 突き or 小手.
* Opponent steps forward with intention to 攻め and strike 面.
* Dominate the center and push body and hips forward to strike 面 immediately.

出ばな小手

* From 刀間合い, push in with 攻め足 to 突き or 小手
* Opponent steps forward, with the intention to 攻め and raises 剣先 to strike 面.
* Anticipate attack, and as opponent's 剣先 rises, step forward with small quick footwork and strike 小手 with small fast action using 手の打ち.

**NB**: Try stepping forward so your right foot faces opponent's right foot when striking.

Practice types:

* From 刀間合い use 攻め足. 元立ち reacts by pushing forward to strike 攻め-面 \(2 step cut due to 間合い\) - as they push forward, dominate center and strike 小手 or 面.
* As a pair step forward and back using 摺足「すりあし」trying to reach an advantageous 間合い and position. Once you feel opportunity strike 元立ち as they step forward \(or back\) - can be repeated with both trying to strike. 

## 応じ技

### 抜き技

This is an evasion technique, where you avoid opponent so his strike cuts only air, and counter attack. You need to anticipate opponent's intent, and timing is vital. If you move too soon, you will signal your intention, and this becomes his opportunity. If you move too late, you will be struck.

Start by learning large 技 with 摺足「すりあし」, and late 踏み込み足「ふみこみあし」, where a rear step is required. Later, using small action, learn to position left foot to allow fast dynamic counter attacks.

#### 面-抜き-胴

* Press in with 攻め足, 攻め to body or 小手, and wait for reaction.
* As opponent swings down to strike 面, step diagonally forward right on the right foot while swinging up 竹刀.
* Immediately turn wrist and strike his right 胴.
* Pass close to opponent pulling 竹刀 through, and turn to them in 中段 for 残心.

**NB**:

* Move with the whole body. Keep posture upright, push forward the hips.
* Your footwork must be fast.
* Pass close to opponent as if hitting shoulder.

#### 小手-抜き面

* Press in with 攻め足, 攻め to 面, and wait for reaction.
* As opponent swings down to strike 小手, step back on the left foot, quickly swinging up 竹刀 in a large movement.
* Opponents 竹刀 will swing down on to thin air
* Immediately step forward and strike his right 面.
* 体当たり, 鍔迫り合い or pass through and turn to them in 中段 for 残心

**NB**:

* Evade with entire body not just hands.
* Step back with feeling of going forward - position of left foot vital  - try 速素振り「はやすぶり」footwork.
* Swing 竹刀 up in large rapid motion
* The entire sequence must be one continuous action.
* It is possible to also evade from below by dropping 剣先 and stepping diagonally back.

Many other 抜き技 exist, such as 面-抜き面 \(see 日本剣道方一本目\) and 小手-引き-小手 \(see 日本剣道方一本目)

### 擦り上げ技

This is a raising slide technique used to deflect opponents attack and immediately counter strike. The parrying action is similar principle as 払い技, but the timing is after sen.

Here the strike has begun and we deflect his 竹刀 during the strike.

#### 小手-擦り上げ面 \(裏「うら」\)

* 攻め足, 攻め to 面, and wait for reaction
* Opponent reacts by cutting your 小手.
* As they strike down, push forward and sweep 竹刀 forward and up in a right semi-circular arc parrying with the right side of 物打ち.
* Top of sweep must be center, immediately strike 面.

**Important**:

* Learn basics with 摺足「すりあし」, and large movements. Here you must place left foot back to correct 打ち間合い position as they strike, still trying to do 技 going forwards.
* Later add 踏み込み足「ふみこみあし」, and then try small fast movements.
* Due to the different 間合い for 小手 and 面 it is best to 擦り上げ and strike 面 going forward in one continuous action.
* 擦り上げ is part of 振り被り「ふりかぶり」 motion; remember it is the strike that is the object of 技.
* The position of the left foot is important.
* During 擦り上げ have feeling of advancing hips, left hand must move forward and up along 振り被り「ふりかぶり」 path, and right fist rolls to the right with a snapping action.
* Try to parry close to the middle of opponent's 竹刀.
* Reverse above and try 技 - 表「おもて」」.

#### 面-擦り上げ面 \(表「おもて」」\)

* 攻め足, 攻め to 小手 or 突き, and wait for reaction
* Opponent reacts by cutting your 面.
* As they strike down, step forward and right and sweep 竹刀 forward and up in a left semi-circular arc parrying with the left side of 物打ち.
* Top of sweep must be central, you face opponent, immediately strike 面. Your left foot should end in line with opponent's left foot.

**Important**:

* Learn basics with 摺足「すりあし」, add large movements.
* Later add 踏み込み足「ふみこみあし」, and then try small fast movements.
* Due to close 間合い, this is a very difficult timing to master - try with feeling of 踏み込み足「ふみこみあし」almost on the spot
* Try to catch strike early, parrying close to the middle of opponent's 竹刀.
* Try reverse, 技 on 裏「うら」 side also.
* Can be executed with back step action \(see 日本剣道方五本目)

Many other 擦り上げ技 exist, such as 突き-擦り上げ面 and 小手-擦り上げ小手 \(日本剣道方 - 六本目)

### 返し技

This is a reflex deflection technique in which you parry with one side of the 竹刀 using the opponent's energy to reverse direction and counter strike to other side. Again, many options exist for this 技, and I have again selected those most simple and therefore most practical:

#### 剣-返し-胴 \(右\)

* 攻め to 小手 or 突き and wait for reaction
* Opponent strikes 面.
* As they strike down, push forward and right and lift 竹刀 forward and up a parrying with the left side.
* Rotate the wrists over, using the strikes force to change direction and immediately strike their 右胴 while stepping forward diagonally right from your right foot.
* Pass each other, turn towards opponent with 残心.

**Important**:

* Learn basics with 摺足「すりあし」, and large movements.
* Try practicing 技 straight in front, then later with forward right diagonal step.
* Later add 踏み込み足「ふみこみあし」, and then try small fast movements.
* Have feeling of "catching" opponent's 竹刀 as far forward as possible.
* Hand must not rise above head level - neck level sufficient
* Use small fast footwork going forward - NEVER go backward.
* There must be no break between parry and striking.

#### 小手-返し-面

* 攻め to 面 and wait for reaction.
* Opponent strikes 小手
* As they strike down, step back diagonally to the left on the left foot, and lift 竹刀 forward and up \(剣先 down\) parrying with the left side.
* Rotate the wrists over, using the strikes force to change direction and immediately strike their 正面 while stepping forward with your right foot.
* 体当たり or pass and turn towards opponent with 残心.

**Important**:

* Learn basics with 摺足「すりあし」, and large movements.
* Later add 踏み込み足「ふみこみあし」, and then try small fast movements.
* Wrist must be flexible.
* Can also be done stepping straight back.
* Small fast 技 can be done without rear step.

Other versions includes 面-返し-面 and 小手-返し-小手. These both have difficult 間合い, and I have seen them performed striking going backward, i.e. 小手-返し-引き小手.

### 打ち落とし-技

This is a downward striking technique. You strike down opponents strikes to spoil its effects and upset their balance, while giving you an opportunity to counter strike.

#### 胴-打ち落とし-面

* 攻め to 面 and wait for reaction
* Opponent strikes the 胴.
* As they strike down, step back diagonally to the left on the left foot, and swing 竹刀 up.
* Strike opponents 竹刀 down to the right with strong 手の打ち.
* Immediately strike their 正面 while stepping forward with your right foot.
* 体当たり or pass and turn towards opponent with 残心.

**NB**: Use of 手の打ち important here. Try to strike 竹刀 close to their 鍔.

Also, if opponent drive forward quickly, strike 引き面.

#### 小手-打ち落とし-面

* 攻め to 面 \(or body\) and wait for reaction.
* Opponent strikes 小手.
* As they strike down, step back diagonally to the left on the left foot, and swing 竹刀 up.
* Strike opponents 竹刀 down to the right with strong 手の打ち.
* Immediately strike their 正面 while stepping forward with your right foot.
* 体当たり or pass and turn towards opponent with 残心.

**Important**:

* Learn basics with 摺足「すりあし」, and large movements.
* Later add 踏み込み足「ふみこみあし」, then try small fast movements.
* Use of 手の打ち important here. Strike 竹刀 down close to their 鍔 with small sharp action.
* With small fast 技: strike down opponent's 竹刀 with feeling of striking their right 小手, then strike 面 immediately - have feeling of small fast 小手-面 striking - maintain the center line \(中心「ちゅうしん」\)
* Very effective against opponent cutting 小手 at an angle.
