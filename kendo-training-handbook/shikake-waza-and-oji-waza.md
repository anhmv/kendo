# 仕掛け業と応じ業

Kendo techniques \(waza\) are usually group into two categories:

1. Shikake-waza: techniques for initiating an attack. These positive attacking techniques are used to challenge and forestall the opponent, gaining the center, and thus an opportunity.
2. Oji-waza: techniques where you avoid or parry opponent's strike and counter attack at the resulting weakness. It is commonly said that in Kendo we never defend for the sake of defense, but as a way of striking ourselves. Oji means response, but we cannot wait to be attacked. We should still probe our opponent's kamae, leading with our ki, to force their attack which we can use to generate an opportunity to strike.

The situation is not however so clear cut. Rather like the idea of ying and yang, these ideas have to be balance, and merge into one another. What may start as shikake-waza may end as oji-waza. An example here is to initiate the attack with harai-waza but you are countered by debana-waza - you then counter and strike with the same action, but this is now suriage-waza. Only by constant training can we hope to react correctly.

You should be able to move and strike correctly as disccued in previous section. All the following assumes these previous kihon have learnt, and that seme is used. These waza are then used according to opponent's response \(see Kikai - chapter 8\).

These two categories are further divided into sub groups of similar techniques. I have only listed a few. I have made my choices based on what senior sensei most commonly teach us. and on the ideas and goals of the Bokuto ni yoru kendo kihon waza keiko ho.

I have heard different ideas with regards to the learning and use of the different waza. It is an old kendo dictum that says it takes three years to learn the basics. This I believe depends on the person and how much they practice, but still without the ability to perform large correct strikes, it is impossible to progress to complex techniques. However, Kendo without waza can become dull if you think of only striking Men. The use of the Bokuto ni yoru Kendo kihon waza keiko ho is a good way of introducing the ideas of waza. I have read that these are designed to teach students these basics of waza by the time they reach 2nd Dan. To begin with, concentrate on Shikake-waza, taking the initiative to strike going forwards.

## Shikake-waza

### Ippon uchi no waza

These attacks are performed as the basic Kihon strikes already discussed. They sometimes go under other names, such as Tobikomi-waza and hikibana-waza, but these are really ways of describing the seme and timing. Some basic ideas and practices are:

* Men-uchi: from to-ma, push in with full spirited seme to tsuki. Opponent hesitates or retreats - drive forward controlling center and strike Men.
* Men-uchi: from to-ma, push in with seme to kote. Opponent drops kensen to cover your shinai - take center and strike Men.
* Kote-uchi: from to-ma, seme to men or tsuki. Opponent raises kensen to defend showing a weakness - strike Kote.
* Dou-uchi: from to-ma, push in with seme to men as if about to strike. Opponent raise shinai to block revealing dou, leap forward and strike.

### Renzoku-waza \(Ni san dan no waza\)

There are two methods of using these techniques.

1. The first attack rather than just seme is used to destroy opponents spirit and posture, revealing an opportunity to strike. These actions must be performed in a continuous unbroken sequence. you must strike with determination, not a mere feinting action.
2. When first attack unsuccessful, observe the change in opponent's position, respond to their movement and strikes again \(and again\) until a valid strike is made. The correct continuous rhythm must be maintained.

**NB**: In shiai, even if first strike was a perfect ippon, it would not count if sencond strike was unsuccessful - keep this in mind.

* Kote-men: from to-ma, push in with full spirit and strike kote. Opponent defends and retreats - pull left foot quickly up into place, drive forward and strike Men.
* Kote-dou: from to-ma, push in with full spirit and strike Kote. Opponent avoids and anticipates men cut blocking while retreating or retreats while raising shinai to perform nuki-waza - pull left foot quickly up into place, drive forward \(diagonally right\) and strike Dou.
* Men-dou: from to-ma, push in with full spirit and strike Men. Opponent avoids and anticipates men cut blocking \(while retreating\) - pull left foot quickly up into place, drive forward \(diagonally right\) and strike Dou. \(Maai is harder here - control footwork to strike with monouchi\).
* Men-men: from to-ma, push in with full spirit and strike men. Opponent anticipates strike and retreats while losing strong kamae - pull left foot quickly up into place, and strike men. \(this is a case where opponent is trying to avoid making first strike ineffective\).

Many other combinations exist, such as tsuki-men, kote-men-do, men, tai-atari, hiki-men.

When practicing, keep the following in mind:

1. Begin with large striking action and body movements, where motodachi moves back sufficiently to allow correct striking.
2. Later, use small techniques where motodachi does not have to move to allow second strike.
3. The left foot must be drawn up immediately \(hikituke\) to allow correct striking in good posture.
4. Learn to control the size of your steps. You must move body in posture to allow striking with monouchi.
5. Each strike must be made in full spirit.
6. Your tenouchi must be tightened and relaxed with each strike. Correct tenouchi is essential.
7. Perform actions in one continuous attack sequence.

### Harai-waza

When your opponent has a strong chudan-no-kamae there is no chance to strike. The kensen must be moved away from the center to give an opportunity. This can be achieved by Harai-age - parrying their shinai diagonally upward to the left or right or Harai-otoshi - parrying it diagonally down to the left, controlling the center and striking immediately.

There are several key aspects that must be observed or considered to be effective:

1. You must use perform the sweeping action with your body \(moving forward\), not just your hands - sweeping with seme-ashi.
2. Use both hands to parry, at the moment of parry snap your wrist to sharpen action.
3. Parry in a semi-circular motion. Your hands must move quickly forward and up along the path of furi-kaburi.
4. Parry the midpoint of opponent's shinai using monouchi of your shinai.
5. The curved movement allows sweeping action to finish at the end of furi-kaburi, and ensures shinai in the correct position to strike - all in one action.
6. At the beginning, learn techniques using suri-ashi and large techniques.
7. Later use small sweeping action and fast powerful fumi-komi.
8. The entire action must be made in one continuous action.

The timing and opportunities are also critical:

* When stationary, the kamae is strongest. You will gain great advantage performing this waza at the moment opponent advances to attack or retreats.
* Harai-age most effective when opponent's kensen higher then your own.
* Harai-otoshi most effective against a kensen lower than your own.

**NB**: You can set the level of your kensen as part of seme, i.e. to Kote, is lower position.

#### Harai-men \(omote\)

* Push forward while sweeping up shinai from lower right to upper left in semi circular action knocking kensen of opponent away from the center.
* Maintaining the center, immediately \(in one motion\) strike shoumen.

#### Harai-men \(ura\)

* Drop kensen slightly, and push forward while sweeping up shinai form lower left to upper right in semi circular action knocking kensen of opponent away from the center.
* Maintaining the center, immediately \(in one motion\) strike shoumen

#### Harai-kote \(ura\)

* Drop kensen slightly, and push forward while sweeping up shinai from lower left to upper right in semi circular action knocking kensen of opponent away from the center.
* Maintaining the center, immediately \(in one motion\) strike kote. This requires quick action and small fast footwork.

#### Harai-kote \(otoshi\)

* Raise kensen and push forward while sweeping down shinai from upper right to lower left with sharp tenouchi in a small circular action knocking kensen of opponent down to your left.
* Your kensen must return immediately to the center position, from where you can complete the strike to shoumen.

Again, many other options of the waza exist, such as harai-tsuki, ura, omote and otoshi.

#### Hiki-wara

There are stepping back techniques, a waza where you strike while retreating from close quarters. These techniques are usually performed from tsuba-zeriai after a previous attack. You must first break your opponent's guard either by tai-atari or pushing opponent to off balance them and break posture.

Tsuba-zeriai means to fight on compete with the hand guard \(see Kamae\)

* The foot work is hard to master.
* First practice using suri-ashi and large actions then later use small fast actions and powerful footwork.
* Push with right foot/knee, body, hips and arms. But do not push arms forward or allow them to collapse inward - left fist must remain in correct position to strike.

There any many ways of breaking the kamae from tsuba-zerai, I will discuss the basic ideas only:

**Hiki-men**

* From tsuba-zeriai, push forward with seme-ashi. Push shinai inward towards body or their right shoulder.
* Wait for opponent to push back, trying to maintain their kamae
* Immediately step back from the left leg to uchima, with the feeling of pulling opponent toward you.
* Opponent should now be off balance and kensen will drop forward \(to your left\) giving an opportunity.
* Stamp the right foot \(fumi-komi-ashi\) while striking men with ki-ken-tai-ichi, and flick left foot up and back to move back showing zanshin.

**NB**: Zanshin - do not pull arms above the head, when retreating keep hands forward \(may be slightly raised, kensen point up\). Retreat about 3 steps and take chudan-no-kamae at appropriate distance.

**Hiki-do**

* From tsuba-zeriai, press in and down with seme-ashi. Push shinai and hands down.
* Wait for opponent to resist, push hands back up, trying to maintain their kamae.
* Immediately step back from the left leg to uchima, with the feeling of push opponent's hands up as you swing up.
* Opponent's arm will rise
* Rotate wrist and strike the Dou while stamping the right foot \(fumi-komi-ashi\) and flick left foot up and back to move back showing zanshin.

**NB**: Zanshin - do not pull arms back when retreating, keep hands forward in striking position \(may be slightly raised, kensen point up\). Retreat about 3 steps and take chudan-no-kamae at appropriate distance.

**Hiki-kote**

* From tsuba-zeriai, push forward and down with seme-ashi. Push shinai inward towards body as if trying to touch the neck of opponent.
* Wait for opponent to push back, trying to maintain their kamae
* Immediately step diagonally back to the left, starting from the left leg, to uchima, maybe have feeling of flicking left hand up beneath opponent's hand.
* Opponent should now be off balance and kensen will rise, giving an opportunity.
* Stamp the right foot \(fumi-komi-ashi\) while striking a straight kote with ki-ken-ita-ichi, and flick left foot and back to move back showing zanshin.

**NB**: Zanshin - do not pull arms back when retreating, keep hands forward in striking position \(may be slightly raised, kensen point up\). Retreat about 3 steps and take chudan-no-kamae at appropriate distance.

You can practice this waza in many different ways:

* From tsuba-zeriai, compete to find opening and strike. Motodachi should follow up to help develop speed of your footwork and zanshin.
* Strike opponent, then both performs tai-atari, and kakari-te will strike with hiki-waza
* Strike opponent. Motodachi will "block" strike - both perform tai-atari, and kakarite will strike with hiki-waza
* Strike opponent. Motodachi will "block" strike and move aside, and kakarite turns as they pass and will strike again with hiki-waza
* Motodachi strike \(men\) - you block attack using correct uke-kata, and immediately use hiki-waza to strike them.

#### Debana-waza

Just as the opponent moves toward you on the verge of striking, they are likely to be concentrating on their own technique, loosing sight of your actions, thus presenting you with a good opportunity to strike.

You must strike at first sign of their intentions to attack. if you wait for kensen to left, you have already missed the chance.

**Debana-men**

* From to-ma, push in with seme ashi to tsuki or kote.
* Opponent steps forward with intention to seme and strike men.
* Dominate the center and push body and hips forward to strike Men immediately.

Debana-kote

* From to-ma, push in with seme ashi to tsuki or kote
* Opponent steps forward, with the intention to seme and raises kensen to strike Men.
* Anticipate attack, and as opponent's kensen rises, step forward with small quick footwork and strike kote with small fast action using tenouchi.

**NB**: Try stepping forward so your right foot faces opponent's right foot when striking.

Practice types:

* From to-ma use seme-ashi. motodachi reacts by pushing forward to strike seme-men \(2 step cut due to ma-ai\) - as they push forward, dominate center and strike kote or men.
* As a pair step forward and back using suri \(okuri\) - ashi trying to reach an advantageous ma-ai and position. Once you feel opportunity strike motodachi as they step forward \(or back\) - can be repeated with both trying to strike. 

## Oji-waza

### Nuki-waza

This is an evasion technique, where you avoid opponent so his strike cuts only air, and counter attack. You need to anticipate opponent's intent, and timing is vital. If you move too soon, you will signal your intention, and this becomes his opportunity. If you move too late, you will be struck.

Start by learning large waza with suri-ashi, and late fumikomi-ashi, where a rear step is required. Later, using small action, learn to position left foot to allow fast dynamic counter attacks.

#### Men-nuki-Do

* Press in with seme-ashi, seme to body or kote, and wait for reaction.
* As opponent swings down to strike men, step diagonally forward right on the right foot while swinging up shinai.
* Immediately turn wrist and strike his right Dou.
* Pass close to opponent pulling shinai through, and turn to them in chudan for zanshin.

**NB**:

* Move with the whole body. Keep posture upright, push forward the hips.
* Your footwork must be fast.
* Pass close to opponent as if hitting shoulder.

#### Kote-nuki-men

* Press in with seme-ashi, seme to men, and wait for reaction.
* As opponent swings down to strike kote, step back on the left foot, quickly swinging up shinai in a large movement.
* Opponents shinai will swing down on to thin air
* Immediately step forward and strike his right men.
* Tai-atari, tsuba-zeriai or pass through and turn to them in chudan for zanshin

**NB**:

* Evade with entire body not just hands.
* Step back with feeling of going forward - position of left foot vital  - try haya suburi footwork.
* Swing shinai up in large rapid motion
* The entire sequence must be one continuous action.
* It is possible to also evade from below by dropping kensen and stepping diagonally back.

Many other nuki-waza exist, such as Men-nuki-men \(see Nihon kendo kata - ipponme\) and kote-niki-kote \(see Nihon kendo kata - nihonme\)

### Suriage-waza

This is a raising slide technique used to deflect opponents attack and immediately counter strike. The parrying action is similar principle as Harai-waza, but the timing is after sen.

Here the strike has begun and we deflect his shinai during the strike.

#### Kote-suriage-men \(Ura\)

* seme-ashi, seme to men, and wait for reaction
* Opponent reacts by cutting your kote.
* As they strike down, push forward and sweep shinai forward and up in a right semi-circular arc parrying with the right side of monouchi.
* Top of sweep must be center, immediately strike men.

**Important**:

* Learn basics with suri-ashi, and large movements. Here you must place left foot back to correct uchima position as they strike, still trying to do waza going forwards.
* Later add fumikomi-ashi, and then try small fast movements.
* Due to the different maai for kote and men it is best to suriage and strike men going forward in one continuous action.
* Suriage is part of furi-kaburi motion; remember it is the strike that is the object of waza.
* The position of the left foot is important.
* During suriage have feeling of advancing hips, left hand must move forward and up along furi-kaburi path, and right fist rolls to the right with a snapping action.
* Try to parry close to the middle of opponent's shinai.
* Reverse above and try waza - Omote.

#### Men-suriage-men \(omote\)

* seme-ashi, seme to kote or tsuki, and wait for reaction
* Opponent reacts by cutting your men.
* As they strike down, step forward and right and sweep shinai forward and up in a left semi-circular arc parrying with the left side of monouchi.
* Top of sweep must be central, you face opponent, immediately strike men. Your left foot should end in line with opponent's left foot.

**Important**:

* Learn basics with suri-ashi, add large movements.
* Later add fumikomi-ashi, and then try small fast movements.
* Due to close maai, this is a very difficult timing to master - try with feeling of fumikomi-ashi almost on the spot
* Try to catch strike early, parryign close to the middle of opponent's shinai.
* Try reverse, waza on ura side also.
* Can be executed with back step action \(see nihon kendo kata - gohonme\)

Many other suriage-waza exist, such as tsuki-suriage-men and kote-suriage-kote \(nihonkendo kata - ropponme\)

### Kaeshi-waza

This is a reflex deflection technique in which you parry with one side of the shinai using the opponent's energy to reverse direction and counter strike to other side. Again, many options exist for this waza, and I have again selected those most simple and therefore most practical:

#### Ken-kaeshi-do \(migi\)

* Seme to kote or tsuki and wait for reaction
* Opponent strikes men.
* As they strike down, push forward and right and lift shinai forward and up a parrying with the left side.
* Rotate the wrists over, using the strikes force to change direction and immediately strike their migi dou while stepping forward diagonally right from your right foot.
* Pass each other, turn towards opponent with zanshin.

**Important**:

* Learn basics with suri-ashi, and large movements.
* Try practicing waza straight in front, then later with forward right diagonal step.
* Later add fumikomi-ashi, and then try small fast movements.
* Have feeling of "catching" opponent's shinai as far forward as possible.
* Hand must not rise above head level - neck level sufficient
* Use small fast footwork going forward - NEVER go backward.
* There must be no break between parry and striking.

#### Kote-kaeshi-men

* Seme to men and wait for reaction.
* Opponent strikes kote
* As they strike down, step back diagonally to the left on the left foot, and lift shinai forward and up \(kensen down\) parrying with the left side.
* Rotate the wrists over, using the strikes force to change direction and immediately strike their shoumen while stepping forward with your right foot.
* Tai-atari or pass and turn towards opponent with zanshin.

**Important**:

* Learn basics with suri-ashi, and large movements.
* Later add fumikomi-ashi, and then try small fast movements.
* Wrist must be flexible.
* Can also be done stepping straight back.
* Small fast waza can be done without rear step.

Other versions includes men-kaeshi-men and kote-kaeshi-kote. These both have difficult maai, and I have seen them performed striking going backward, i.e. Koke-kaeshi-hiki kote.

### Uchiotoshi-waza

This is a downward striking technique. You strike down opponents strikes to spoil its effects and upset their balance, while giving you an opportunity to counter strike.

#### Do-uchiotoshi-men

* seme to men and wait for reaction
* Opponent strikes the dou.
* As they strike down, step back diagonally to the left on the left foot, and swing shinai up.
* Strike opponents shinai down to the right with strong tenouchi.
* Immediately strike their shoumen while stepping forward with your right foot.
* Tai-atari or pass and turn towards opponent with zanshin.

**NB**: Use of tenouchi important here. Try to strike shinai close to their tsuba.

Also, if opponent drive forward quickly, strike hiki-men.

#### kote-uchiotoshi-men

* seme to men \(or body\) and wait for reaction.
* Opponent strikes kote.
* As they strike down, step back diagonally to the left on the left foot, and swing shinai up.
* Strike opponents shinai down to the right with strong tenouchi.
* Immediately strike their shomen while stepping forward with your right foot.
* Tai-atari or pass and turn towards opponent with zanshin.

**Important**:

* Learn basics with suri-ashi, and large movements.
* Later add fumikomi-ashi, then try small fast movements.
* Use of tenouchi important here. Strike shinai down close to their tsuba with small sharp action.
* With small fast waza: strike down opponent's shinai with feeling of striking their right kote, then strike men immediately - have feeling of small fast kote-men striking - maintain the center line \(chushin\)
* Very effective against opponent cutting kote at an angle.
