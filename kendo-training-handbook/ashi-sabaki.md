# 足捌き「あしさばき」

足捌き「あしさばき」is the collective term for all 剣道 footwork techniques. 足捌き is the single most important physical aspect of 剣道; it is the foundation of all 剣道 skills. Without good footwork \(without a strong foundation\), it is difficult, if not impossible to build the structures of 剣道 technique. There are four primary footwork techniques: 送り足「おくりあし」, 開き足「ひらきあし」,歩み足「あゆみあし」, and 次足「つぎあし」. \(The first 3 are used most frequently.\)

## 送り足「おくりあし」

Of the four footwork techniques, 送り足「おくりあし」 is the principal technique, as it allows coordinated body movement in all directions and can be associated with all 剣道 techniques. The movement is a simple shuffle step with the foot corresponding to the direction of travel initiating the movement.

## 開き足「ひらきあし」

開き足「ひらきあし」 is a footwork technique applied when a diagonal movement would prove advantageous in avoiding an opponent's attack and open opportunities for a counterattack. 開き「ひらき」 means "open". As the name implies, this footwork allows a person to step out of the way, opening the path of an advancing opponent, while maintaining correct guard posture of the body and feet.

## 歩み足「あゆみあし」

歩み足「あゆみあし」 is the same as a walking step and is used in situations requiring rapid movement across an extended distance.

## 次足「つぎあし」

次足「つぎあし」 is an advanced footwork technique. It is normally recommend leaving this practice to later in your study \(Shodan +\) as it can lead to bad habits forming in 基本. 次足 is used to move forward quickly across a distance greater than would be possible to cover using 送り足「おくりあし」. I was taught \(as older texts describe it\), when practicing 次足, it is particularly important to keep in mind the basic rule that the foot corresponding to the direction of movement is advanced first. In other words, the 次足 technique starts with forward foot advancing first, then followed by the left foot being drawn even with the right to complete the first step of the movement. Do not move the left foot first - in all circumstances, moving the trail foot first is incorrect and should not be practiced, Fig A. However, I note that some newer texts and more recent instruction have described it as drawing up the left foot parallel with the right, and then immediately steeping forward on the right foot, Fig B. Please discuss this with for coach/sensei before practicing.

## 摺足「すりあし」 \(Sliding step\)

* All 足捌き「あしさばき」 should be learnt and practiced with 摺足「すりあし」- sliding step.
* Slide \(actually glide\) your feet across the floor without pointing toes up.
* Keeping the heel stlightly raised, and sliding the ball of feet and toes helps slide feet smoothly.
* Do not drag feet; try to make 足捌き「あしさばき」 smooth and graceful.
* This footwork is ideal for wooden smooth surfaces, but will be difficult on treated anti-slip surfaces.
* If your toes rise, it may be due to the step being to large - try smaller steps.

## 踏切「ふみきり」と 踏み込み足「ふみこみあし」(Lung forward with stamping footwork\)

To execute this footwork correctly is difficult to do, and can take several years to do properly. I have broken the sequence of movements down, and later will describe some practice ideas.

* 踏切「ふみきり」: a forceful kick /push off the floor with the leg to begin a "jum" forward.
* 踏み切り足「ふみきりあし」: the leg/foot which provides force and stability by pushing off the floor, in a forward strike the left leg, in retreat the right leg.
* 踏み切り動作「ふみきりどうさ」: the motion of pushing off the floor with 踏み切り足「ふみきりあし」.
* 踏み込み「ふみこみ」: a firm stamping step with the forward to stabilise the body.
* 踏み込み足「ふみこみあし」: the foot which stamps on the floor with the entire sole.
* 踏み込み動作「ふみこみどうさ」: the series of motions from stamping, recovery to a stable position by bringing the left foot in after a rapid lunge and accomplished by the continuous body movement forward with 送り足「おくりあし」.

The processes to complete these actions are:

* Without bending the left leg, lunge forward the hips maintaining your posture.
* The right foot should move forward parallel to, and just above the floor - don't points toes upwards.
* Straighten your right leg, causing you to stamp the floor with right foot - feeling of slapping the floor with the foot. Remember, 踏み込み「ふみこみ」is to stabilize your body, and the loud stamping slap is the result, not the aim.
* The above action should straight posture and bring hips and left leg/foot up behind the right. \(Similar feeling to when stepping up\) - Again left leg/knee straight.
* The body should naturally want to keep moving forward with its momentum - use 送り足「おくりあし」to continue forward movement.
* **Do not cheat**. Since it is hard to reach our training partner with one _踏み込み「ふみこみ」,_ people tend to cheat to get closer to their training partner. Common cheating to shorten the distance between you and your training partner is using 次足 and 歩み足「あゆみあし」.

## 攻め足「せめあし」

This will be mentioned in later chapters. The right foot action is called '攻め足「せめあし」 \(foot used for Seme\) when you move your right foot slightly \(only slightly\) forward, without leaning forward. Have the feeling of pushing right knee, foot and hips forward as if pressing into opponent.

## 軸足「じくあし」

This is the left foot. \(Foot used for supporting the body\) - The left foot must remain planted in the correct position to allow you to push forward and attack immediately. Do not lose the feeling that your left foot, left leg, left hip and left side of the body are connected.

**NB**: _If the distance between your right foor and left foot is to wide from front to rear, or the center of gravity moves forward and backward or from backward to forward, or your upper body leans forward and backward in the Kamae, whilst you are trying to give pressure to each other, inviting to initiate an attack, you will not be able to use both feet as described above._

## **Main points for all footwork**:

1. It is **important** that during 足捌き「あしさばき」, that you move maintaining your posture. Have the feeling of moving your hips/tanden along, keeping constant eye level.
2. Keeping your posture must prevent back heel touch the floor. During 送り足「おくりあし」make sure left heel does not touch floor when stepping back.
3. Especially during 送り足「おくりあし」, never drag the rear foot - it must "snap" up immediately behind the front foot. 引きつけ is the action of immediately drawing / pulling up the back foot.
4. The foot corresponding to the direction of movement is advanced first. For example, when moving forward the forward foot leads the movement. Likewise when moving backward, the back foot leads. When moving left, the left foot leads, etc. This is the general rule for all footwork techniques.
5. The speed and strength of both feet should be synchronous, the trailing foot being drawn back to its correct guard position quickly. This tempo was termed "Inyo-ashi" \(shadow and light foot-movement\) by Miyamoto Musashi. Musashi wrote: "_When you cut, when you retreat, and even when you deflect an attack you step right-left-right-left with Inyo-ashi._"
6. The upper body should remain toned, yet relaxed so the shoulders, arms, and shinai do not sway or bob when moving.

## **Conditions to avoid**

In the Book of Five Rings, Miyamoto Musashi invalidates three type of footwork methods:跳び足「とびあし」, 浮き足「うきあし」, and 踏みすゆる「ふみすゆる」.

### **跳び足「とびあし」 \(Jumping foot\)**

This foot movement is exhibited when the lead foot is raised upward upon the execution of a step or strike

### **浮き足「うきあし」 \(Floating foot\)**

This foot movement is when one foot is not grounded. This situation occurs when the body weight is not centered between the feet, allowing one foot to move lightly over the floor while the opposite foot bears the body weight.

### **踏みすゆる　\(Stuck foot\)**

When the feet are inactive - fixed in their position.
