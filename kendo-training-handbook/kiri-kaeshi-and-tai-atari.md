# 切り返しと体当たり

The importance of training the fundamentals has already been mentioned. 切り返し is an important practice method for beginners and experience 剣道家「けんどうか」 alike. It should be used at the start and end of practice as a warming up and cooling down exercise.

I will later discuss all the benefits of 切り返し, but first is how to practice it.

## 切り返し

Important points to check:

* All movements must be as large as possible
* Movements of body and striking action coordinated correctly.
* Do not sever the mental connection between you and your opponent and perform all motions in an unbroken series.
* When swinging the 竹刀 upward, make sure it reaches center position well above your head.
* Make the left and right strikes at an angle of about 45 degrees, beginning with a strike to the left side \(your right\)
* Keep shoulder relaxed, extend elbows when striking, and keep left fist centered.
* Keep correct 間合い and make sure you cut with the 物内.
* It is important for beginners to practice correctly with slow and exaggerated movements rather than with speed.
* Always end with a strike to the left side \(your right\)
* Use strong 気合い and correct and controlled breathing.

If 切り返し is not done properly it will not have the desired results. It is essential to practice fully committed and correctly. If one seeks only speed, striking will become imprecise and small. Aim for precision and with improvement gradually increase speed.

### 切り返し practice

#### 掛かり手「かかりて」

* From 刀間合い give loud 気合い, 攻め「せめ」 to body and perform a large 正面 strike.
* Move forward quickly and 体当たり with good posture. \(Breath allowed\)
* Immediately 振り被り「ふりかぶり」straight up while stepping forward on right foot, and strike continuous 左面 and 右面 - first and last are 左面 \(your right side\).
* Move forward in 送り足「おくりあし」four steps and retreat above five steps \(see below\)
* Cutting the 面 \(not the 竹刀\) from correct 打ち間合い, give loud 気合い \(面, 面, 面, etc\), follow 元立ち movements.
* After last 左 strike, return to 刀間合い in 中段, then repeat above 切り返し actions.
* After last 左 strike, return to 刀間合い in 中段 and
* From 刀間合い give loud 気合い, 攻め「せめ」 to body and perform a large 正面 strike
* Follow through with the final 正面 3-4 steps and show 残心

#### 元立ち

* After 攻め「せめ」, open quickly to allow unobstructed 正面 to be received.
* Receive 体当たり
* Move backward from the left foot and receive alternate 左面 and 右面 strikes, controlling the 間合い using 歩み足「あゆみあし」 footwork. \(Normally 4 back and 5 forward.\)
* Repeat above sequence.
* Then on receiving final 正面, move to your right and let 掛かり手「かかりて」 move passed. Turn and check 残心. The pairs then usually reverse the roles and repeat exercise.\)

The 元立ち role is very important as they control the 間合い for the exercise.

According to 掛かり手「かかりて」's ability, they must alter the speed and intensity of the practice.

1. Allow beginners to strike your 面 by either keeping open 構え or by hold 竹刀 vertically close, and in center of your 面.
2. Block left / right strikes by hold 竹刀 vertically \(or slightly angled inwards\) and moving it to the left and right side, while keeping left wrist at waist level
3. For more advance practice, keep hands more central and stop strikes by striking down their 竹刀.
4. Use 手の内 when blocking to stop your own 面 being struck.
5. Keeps constant rhythm moving backwards and forwards.

A good 元立ち is required for correct 切り返し. Always watch 掛かり手「かかりて」's movements and be able to point out any mistakes.

### Some of the benefits of doing 切り返し

* Improves stamina while learning correct breathing
* Strikes become stronger and reliable
* Learn to keep shoulders relaxed and flexible
* Learn the skill of 手の内
* Developers faster striking technique

### Some of the benefits of receiving 切り返し

* Gain awareness of judging opponents skill.

Always practice 切り返し. Practice it at the start of 稽古「けいこ」 to warm up and prepare oneself for practice, and at the end to correct one's posture. use it to condition one's body.

### Variations on 切り返し practice.

* Practice with 木刀 and 摺足「すりあし」 to master the basic pattern of cutting, blade path, and breathing.
* Practice the sequence striking only 正面 to teach partners footwork and 間合い.
* Practice cutting 左右面 the length or width of the Dojo, Boosting stamina and number of strikes.
* Strike 左胴 and 右胴 forwards and backwards.
* Alternate 左右面 and 胴 strikes.
* 打ち込み「うちこみ」切り返し - perform striking techniques such as 面, 小手面 etc 3 or 5 times, after which the set of 9 - 左右面 cuts, followed by another set of 打ち込み, and another set of 9 左右面 cuts before finishing on 面 or another 3-5 cuts.

The standard format for BKA Grading requires 掛かり手「かかりて」 to execute 体当たり. However, not all senior Sensei say it is necessary. At the start of training, it may be easier for 元立ち just to move backward, as this will not disturb the posture or balance of 掛かり手「かかりて」, and will avoid them pulling hands down after cutting.

## 体当たり

This is the act of colliding with the opponent with the surplus force of a strike. 体当たり is important not only for upsetting the opponents balance and posture and creating an opportunity for a strike, but also for stabilizing your own posture \(especially lower body\).

### Effective & Correct 体当たり

* Your position of your hands and elbows are very important as you make contact. Your left hand should be at the similar level as 中段の構え but slightly left off center line.
* Consequently your right hand will move slightly off center to the right, with 竹刀 lifted up of course, your right hand will be mid chest or a little lower.

**NB**: This will help to stop your elbows from crushing into your 胴 and your 竹刀 will be at slight angle rather than straight up. This is same as discussed in 鍔迫り合い.

Breathing is very important. Do not inhale as you make contact. Hold in some of your breath as contact is made, don't expend all your air striking. Feel that you have a strong 原「はら」 \(tension in stomach muscles\).

* As you meet opponent in 鍔迫り合い, have a feeling like 手の内 in the hands - to make arms strong.
* Use your body and hips to push forward and slightly up while using 踏み込み「ふみこみ」 like footwork. Push forward with arms only so much as they maintain the correct position for swinging up to strike.
* Use left leg and lower back to drive in. The feeling is of a crashing blow rather than a push.
* Whether opponent moves backward or is strong and you move backwards, you must be ready and strike immediately.

When receiving 体当たり, step forward right foot and push in the hips. \(Do not step back when receiving\). You must maintain your balance.

* For 切り返し, allow the force to push you back a step, and receive strikes.
* Otherwise, both should crash into each other. Whoever keeps their posture and arms positioned correctly, can then perform 引き業「ひきわざ」 and strike.

Therefore 体当たり can be used for to purposes:

1. To force back and unbalance opponent to allow you strike going forwards.
2. To force arms in and unbalance opponent, to give you opportunity to perform 引き業.
