# Kiri-kaeshi and Tai-atari

The importance of training the fundamentals has already been mentioned. Kiri-kaeshi is an important practice method for beginners and experience Kendoka alike. It should be used at the start and end of practice as a warming up and cooling down exercise.

I will later discuss all the benefits of Kiri-kaeshi, but first is how to practice it.

# Kiri-kaeshi

Important points to check: 

* All movements must be as large as possible
* Movements of body and striking action coordinated correctly.
* Do not sever the mental connection between you and your opponent and perform all motions in an unbroken series.
* When swinging the shinai upward, make sure it reaches center position well above your head.
* Make the left and right strikes at an angle of about 45 degrees, beginning with a strike to the left side (your right)
* Keep shoulder relaxed, extend elbows when striking, and keep left fist centered.
* Keep correct maai and make sure you cut with the monuchi.
* It is important for beginners to practice correctly with slow and exaggerated movements rather than with speed.
* Always end with a strike to the left side (your right)
* Use strong ki-ai and correct and controlled breathing.

If kiri-kaeshi is not done properly it will not have the desired results. It is essential to practice fully committed and correctly. If one seeks only speed, striking will become imprecise and small. Aim for precision and with improvement gradually increase speed.

## Kiri-kaeshi practice

### Kakarite

* From to-ma give loud ki-ai, seme to body and perform a large shoumen strike.
* Move forward quickly and tai-atari with good posture. (Breath allowed)
* Immediately furi-kaburi straight up while stepping forward on right foot, and strike continuous hidari and migi men - first aand last are hidari men (your right side).
* Move forward in Okuri-ashi (suri-ashi) four steps and retreat above five steps (see below)
* Cutting the men (not the shinai) from correct uchi-ma, give loud Ki-ai (Men, Men, Men, etc), follow Motodachi's movements.
* After last hidari strike, return to to-ma in chuudan, then repeat above kiri-kaeshi actions.
* After last Hidari strike, return to to-ma in chuudan and
* From To-ma give loud Ki-ai, seme to body and perform a large shoumen strike
* Follow through with the final Shoumen 3-4 steps and show Zanshin

### Motodachi

* After seme, open quickly to allow unobstructed shomen to be received.
* Receive tai-atari
* Move backward from the left foot and receive alternate Hidari and Migi men strikes, controlling the ma-ai using ayumi-ashi footwork. (Normally 4 back and 5 forward.)
* Repeat above sequence.
* Then on receiving final shoumen, move to your right and let kakarite move passed. Turn and check zanshin. The pairs then usually reverse the roles and repeat exercise.)

The motodachi role is very important as they control the maai for the exercise.

According to kakarite's ability, they must alter the speed and intensity of the practice.

1. Allow beginners to strike your Men by either keeping open kamae or by hold shinai vertically close, and in center of your men.
2. Block left / right strikes by hold shinai vertically (or slightly angled inwards) and moving it to the left and right side, while keeping left wrist at waist level
3. For more advance practice, keep hands more central and stop strikes by striking down their shinai.
4. Use ten-wo-uchi when blocking to stop your own men being struck.
5. Keeps constant rhythm moving backwards and forwards.

A good motodachi is required for correct kiri-kaeshi. Always watch kakarite's movements and be able to point out any mistakes.

## Some of the benefits of doing kiri-kaeshi

Always practice Kiri-kaeshi. Practice it at the start of Keiko to warm up and prepare oneself for practice, and at the end to correct one's posture. use it to condition one's body.

## Variations on Kiri-kaeshi practice.

* Practice with bokuto and suri-ashi to master the basic pattern of cutting, blade path, and breathing.
* Practice the sequence striking only Shoumen to teach partners footwork and maai.
* Practice cutting sayu-men the length or width of the Dojo, Boosting stamina and number of strikes.
* Strike Hidari and Migi dou forwards and backwards.
* Alternate sayu men and dou strikes.
* Uchikomi kiri-kaeshi - perform striking techniques such as Men, Kote-Men etc 3 or 5 times, after which the set of 9 - sayu men cuts, followed by another set of uchi-komi, and another set of 9-sayu men cuts before finishing on men or another 3-5 cuts.

The standard format for BKA Grading requireds kakari-te to execute tai-atari. However, not all senior Sensei say it is necessary. At the start of training, it may be easier for motodachi just to move backward, as this will not disturb the posture or balance of Kakari-te, and will avoid them pulling hands down after cutting.

# Tai-atari

This is the act of colliding with the opponent with the surplus force of a strike. Tai-atari is important not only for upsetting the opponents balance and posture and creating an opportunity for a strike, but also for stabilizing your own posture (especially lower body).

## Effective & Correct Tai-atari

* Your position of your hands and elbows are very important as you make contact. Your left hand should be at the similar level as chudan kamae but slightly left off center line.
* Consequently your right hand will move slightly off center to the right, with shinai lifted up of course, your right hand will be mid chest or a little lower.

**NB**: This will help to stop your elbows from crushing into your dou and your shinai will be at slight angle rather than straight up. This is same as discussed in tsuba-zeriai.

Breathing is very important. Do not inhale as you make contact. Hold in some of your breath as contact is made, don't expend all your air striking. Feel that you have a strong hara (tension in stomach muscles).

* As you meet opponent in tsuba-zeriai, have a feeling like te-no-uchi in the hands - to make arms strong.
* Use your body and hips to push forward and slightly up while using fumi-komi like footwork. Push forward with arms only so much as they maintain the correct position for swinging up to strike.
* Use left leg and lower back to drive in. The feeling is of a crashing blow rather than a push.
* Whether opponent moves backward or is strong and you move backwards, you must be ready and strike immediately.

When receiving Tai-atari, step forward right foot and push in the hips. (Do not step back when receiving). You must maintain your balance.

* For kiri-kaeshi, allow the force to push you back a step, and receive strikes.
* Otherwise, both should crash into each other. Whoever keeps their posture and arms positioned correctly, can then perform Hiki-waza and strike.

Therefore tai-atairi can be used for to purposes:

1. To force back and unbalance opponent to allow you strike going forwards.
2. To force arms in and unbalance opponent, to give you opportunity to perform hiki-waza.
