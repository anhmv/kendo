# Reigi Saho

The Etiquette, Manners, and Attitudes below should be shown during Kendo training. Remember, in Kendo the ÈÅì \(dou\) refers to the way or path to enlightenment and as such, the attitudes should also be taken with you into everyday life. No matter what your experience or ability in kendo you can always show good reigi.

Reigi is important because it helps to maintain the relationship between the sword and the shinai. By showing such manners you are showing that you respect the fact you are dealing with a real sword and death is a very real possibility. Kendo is a Japanese art, and if we fail to maintain the Japanese identity of kendo, it will lose its meaning.

### Good Etiquette and Manners

* Always ensure your toenails and fingernails are cut short before training.
* Always air your uniform and your armor after each session: never leave them in the bag between sessions or they will get moldy and smell horribly.
* Keep your uniform clean and fold it correctly before attending the session.
* Always check your shinai for splinters before attending the session.
* Do not wear shoes in the dojo.
* Remove all jewellery, including rings and watches before training.
* Turn up early to practice. You shouldn't only just have time to get ready. You should help to prepare the dojo. It is usually the beginners' responsibility to lean the floor before and after every session. With a job or busy lifestyle this can sometimes be hard to achieve but if you make an effort to do this you will eventually understand the benefits. Don't use business or studies for your excuse to miss a session. Management of yourself is still part of your kendo.
* If you are late to practice, enter quietly, warm up and stretch, prepare yourself in seiza and join the from the end of the line.
* Always bow on entering and leaving the dojo.
* If you are warming yourself up before a session you MUST sty in the shimoza. The kamiza is for your sensei and the shomen. Never enter it unless you are doing so to prepare the dojo for practice or are carrying sensei's gear for him. Usually the half near to the entrance is the shimoza and the other half is the kamiza.
* When you bring all your equipment into the dojo take up as little space as possible when you leave it at the side, make sure that it doesn't get in the way of the practice or the doors.
* Do not smoke, eat, drink or fool around in the dojo.
* Do not lean on a sword or rest a shinai or bokuto point downwards. Don't leave your shinai or bokuto in a way that means they cal fall over; they represent your swords which would be of great value. The blade and kensen of your shinai and bokuto should point away from the Kamiza. If the dojo is small, they play your swords on the floor close to the wall.
* Do not step over or kick a shinai on the ground.
* When you are asked to line up, this should be done quickly. KNOW YOUR PLACE IN THE LINE. The order in which you line up is the order of your responsibility in the group, not just your rank.
* Make it a habit to sit in seiza quietly at the beginning and the end of session.
* When you sit in seiza DON'T move about unnecessarily. You should sit with correct posture even if it starts to hurt. Controlling your posture and maintaining seiza even when it becomes uncomfortable is part of kendo. If you have a serious issue swap to cross-legged position but to not move again.
* If someone is kneeling in armor, you should pass behind them or, if you have to pass in front of them, now and extend your right hand in a vertical plane, palm forward.
* Follow the Sensei to whether **Tenugui** is laid over the **Men** or folded inside. If laid out, you should be able to read you tenugui before you put it on.
* When you bow \(shomen-ni, senseigata-ni, or otagai-ni\) always bow longer that your seniors. Also if you are saying 'onegaishimasu' or 'domou arigato gozaimasu' say it correctly.
* When you put on your equipment \(**Men** when we are in seiza, or **Do** after **Kata** practice\) try to be the quickest. However, it is worse if you have to retie your equipment. Be quick but put gear on properly. If your **Men-himo** are too long, shorten them; if your **Kote** are untied, then tie them.
* During practice always bow correctly; 15 degree maintaining eye contact.
* During rotation you have to pass quickly around the back of the sensei - DO NOT slow the whole practice down by being slow.
* Do not interrupt the teacher's instruction, and do not chat to each other during practice. Save questions to when asked or to after final rei.
* If you need to fix your bogu during a session then first ask your partner, move back out of the way and sit in seiza.
* If someone falls over in the dojo, unless it directly involves you, you should continue training. Don't stop and crowd around. Sensei will say if you have to stop, and if you are the first aider, be ready.
* Keep practicing unless you truly can't continue. It is reigi to keep going to get the most out of sensei, they will appreciate that you kept trying despite it causing you pain. Kendo practice means to train you, in other words, to make you feel pain physically and mentally. Don't run away from this.
* Do not lean or lay down: stand, kneel or sit cross-legged when resting.
* It is reigi to be ready for practice, this means eating and drinking enough that you don't become tired and dehydrated. Drunk enough before sessions so you have the energy to continue, and don't let the sensei, the dojo, and yourself down.
* If the weather is very hot, pay extra attention to fluid intake. if you are dehydrated and practicing for a long time such in weather, you may get heat stroke.
* If you vomit or your feet bleed your first responsibility is to clean the dojo floor. After the dojo is cleaned you can take off **Men** and clean it. after which you can tent to yourself.
* Do not just stop practicing. If you cannot continue tell your partner, excuse yourself to the sensei, take seiza and remove equipment in such a way as to not get in the way of practice.
* Only break for rest when invited to by sensei. Take that opportunity to drink fluids and check shinai and bogu.
* Normally drinking will be outside Dojo, or in an assigned area. Bow correctly if leaving the Dojo. Do NOT walk around the Dojo drinking!
* Take your **Men** off correctly: Pull the homo over your head and untie them there. Then take the **Men** off, holding it in front of your face until you have removed the tenugui.
* ALWAYS carry the visiting sensei's equipment for them; you should also fold it for them after the session. If you offer to do this but they don't accept don't give up; offer again.

### Attitudes for Kendo

* Always value the basics.
* Practice repeatedly and many times, practice with someone formidable.
* Practice with proper attitude.
* Practice with courtesy and respect.
* Un-obsessed with winning, practice with desire to study the principles of kendo.
* Have devotion to Kendo and practice with initiative.
* Practice with determination.
* Value graceful, elegant, dignified Kendo.
* Be prepared physically and mentally then practice with eagerness.
* Know your capabilities and practice accordingly.
* Learn by experiencing.
* Always consider ways to improve.
* Be mindful of everyday life.
* Be conscious of safety.
* Be conscious of health and hygiene.
* Do not overextend unreasonably.
* For students, consider how studies and Kendo can be balanced.
* Grasp the value of watching; humbly learn merits of others by observing.
* Always do warming up and cooling down exercises.

### Dojo

The term **Dojo** comes from Buddhism meaning "place to study," which originally referred to the platform Buddha mediated on.

Commit yourself to sincere training when entering Dojo, appreciate having a lace to practice and people to practice with, maintain cleanliness, and take care of your own belongings neatly \(e.g, shoes, clothes, Bogu\).

Know the location of **Kamiza**, the upper seat; this may be a shrine, flag or other symbol. The term **Kamiza** can be written in different Japanese characters which mean "upper seat" or "towards the alter". Beginners line up towards the lower end **Shimoza**.

Reigi is not just a quick bow entering the Dojo, but is about Respect. Know how to correctly bow, and when, where and who to in the Dojo. They are not empty rituals but an expression of respect for all the other members of the dojo who are offering you a chance to practice kendo.

Here is an extract from the Kendo Reader - written some 70+ year ago:

* When entering and leaving the Dojo make a reverend bow.
* Do not enter the Dojo dressed untidily dressed, if dressed in Japanese style a Hakama should be worn.
* Maintain a respectful attitude and most correct posture.
* Be quiet and conscientious, do not engage in noise chatter, laughter, clapping or cheering.
* After eating, allow a suitable amount of time to elapse before training.
* If you have taken alcohol do not enter the Dojo, let alone engage in training.
* The swords is ones soul, the bogy ones armor. Handle them with respect according the correct method.
* The Dojo interior must be cleaned morning and evening and kept tidy.
* Do not comment on other styles of swordsmanship or in each other's technique.
* For those who are training in swordsmanship take caution against shortness of temper of selfishness, do not be quarrelsome but always remain serene of heart.

All senior students make sure the Dojo floor is safe and tape / make any holes etc, while juniors sweep the floor clean.

### About Rei

**Rei** is a way to pay respect and show acknowledgement. Upon entry to the **Dojo**, enter then **Rei** to the **Kamiza**: this is a way to pay respect to the Dojo and to commit yourself to a sincere practice. Also, when exiting, **Rei** to the **Kamiza**, then exit.

### Commands during Training

**Commands at the start will be**:

* **Sei retsu**: line up in correct order. Sometime, before this command, you will hear: **Shinai o motte** or **Bokuto o motte** - with Shinai or with Bokuto.
* **Chakuza**: all sit down in Seiza.
* **Shisei o tadashite**: straighten back/sit up straight.
* **Mokuso**: a brief moment for mediation.
* **Yame**: stop mokuso
* **Shomen nirei**: bow to the flag \(Kamiza\)
* **Sensei \(gatta\) ni rei**: bow to the sensei
* **Otagai ni rei**: bow to each other, and ask "please train with me" by saying; "**Onegai shimasu**"
* **Men o tsuke**: seniors put on men and kote. - when required.

**At the end of practice**:

* **Sei retsu**: line up in correct order
* **Chakuza**: all sit down in Seiza.
* **Men o tore**: Take off kote and men
* **Shisei o tadashite**: straighten back/sit up straight.
* **Mokuso**: a brief moment for mediation.
* **Yame**: stop mokuso
* **Shomen nirei**: bow to the flag \(Kamiza\)
* **Sensei \(gatta\) ni rei**: bow to the sensei
* **Otagai ni rei**: bow to each other, and thank them very much; "**Arigatou gozaimashita**"

Acknowledge **Sensei**, **Senpai** and each other with **Rei**; this is to show repsect and appreciation. To someone seinor, bow first and rise last. The each other, bow together simultaneously.

### Shizen-tai

This natural posture is the basis of all kendo postures and movements.

* The body should not feel strained.
* The face and eyes should face straight forward.
* Stretch the neck upward, and pull the chin back with feeling of stretching top of heat to reach the ceiling. \(There should be no gap between neck and Kendo-gi.\)
* Shoulders are relaxed, with feeling of being held slightly back.
* Arms should hand naturally by your side, with fingers together.
* The hips are help straight, and lower abdomen held taut with feeling of tightening the buttocks.
* Knees should not be bent, but relaxed, i.e. not completely straight legged.
* The feet slightly apart, heels drawn in, you should have your weight evenly applied.

### Ritsu-rei

There are two kinds of standing bow. The one to your opponent \(**moku-rei**\) and secondly, a formal bow, which we use bowing to the Shomen or sensei. The bow can be performed with or without sword \(**shinai**\). The main difference between them is the angle of the bow, and the eye contact.

When entering or leaving the dojo we perform a formal bow towards the Shomen or senior Sensei.

* Keep their body in **shizen-tai** position. Bend you body from the hip. Do not keep your eyes on them. You have to look down. The angle of your body when you bow is 30 degrees.

When bowing to your opponent perform the standard bow \(**boku-rei**\).

* Keep their body in **shizen-tai** position. Bend your body from the hip while looking at your opponent. Do not keep your face straight towards you opponent. You want to keep your chin in. The angle of your body is about 15 degrees, since you have to keep your eyes on your opponent.

Your fingers should remain together, hand slightly on the front side of leg. if you hold a Shinai, it should be at **sage-to**, i.e. straight armed by your side. When bowing the angle of the shinai should not change.

### Seiza

Seiza is the formal kneel sitting position.

To assume seiza:

1. Stand in **shizen-tai**.
2. Draw back the left foot.
3. Kneel down with the left knee next to the right foot.
4. Withdraw the right leg to a position next to the left leg.
5. Tuck the toes of both feet under so the tops of the feet are touching the floor and the big toe of the right foot is overlapping the big toe of the left foot.
6. Lower the hips to a fully seated position. Keep the upper body in correct posture with the hands placed naturally on the thighs.

Standing from seiza is the reverse of sitting:

1. First raise your upper body to a kneeling position.
2. Raise your toes so the balls of the feet are touching the floor.
3. Step forward with the right foot, placing the foot next to the left knee.
4. Push the legs straight to a standing position and then bring the left foot together with the right to end in shizen-tai.

**Main points**:

* Keep the upper body in correct, upright throughout the process of sitting or standing.
* While seated, your eyes should be cast forwards. If listening to Sensei, turn your face towards them, not simply your gaze.
* The large toe of the right foot should be overlapping the large toe of the left foot.
* The knees should be separated by approximately 10cm. \(the with one or two fists.\)

### Moku-so

Moku-so is the act of composing one's breath, posture mind and spirit while in the seiza position and is performed to start and end the practice sessions. When perform moku-so, the hands are brought together to form an oval in front of the abdomen. The fingers of the left hand overlap the fingers of the right hand, and the tips of the thumbs are brought together with light pressure. The eyes are closed halfway and deep breathing is performed. The tongue should be resting in the top of mouth, touching the back of upper teeth.

**Main points**:

* The mind should be cleared of thoughts, but kept fully alert. Sensei says we should focus on our Kendo goals for the practice or to clear our minds by concentrating on breathing, counting the timing of the breathing cycle - this will concentrate you thoughts.
* The eyes should remain slightly open. When the eyes are fully open or closed, the mind tends to remain active, thus making it difficult to correct perform moku-so.

_I quote Zen Master Dogen \(1200-1253\), who stated in the Shobogenzo texts that we must keep our eyes "not so widely open and not so narrowly closed". Therefore, I relax my eyes naturally, focused about 1 metre in front of me._

* Breathing:
  1. Breath in for 3 seconds.
  2. Hold your breath for 2 seconds.
  3. Breath out for 10-15 seconds.

**How to breath**:

1. **Breathe in:**

   Breathe in deeply through your nose, filling your lungs in about 3 seconds. As breathing in, the air goes down to a place called **seika-taden** \(about three fingers down from the belly button\). Using our stomach or abdomen instead of our chest to inhale, we can take in a lot more air. Do not let your shoulders or chest raise during breathing. Chest breathing is not good for kendo as it will show your opponent when we are breathing in, which it is good opportunity for our opponent to attach us.

2. **Hold your breath:**

   We do not breath out the air right after breathing in. We hold the air inside us for a while. It is said that the air should be held in _seika-tanden_, about three fingers down from your belly button. We hold the air in _seika-tanden_ for about 2 seconds.

3. **Breathe out:**

   We breathe out through our mouth, slowly, not at once. It takes about 10-15 seconds to breath out the air. When we breath out, we have to control the breathing. In order to do so, we have to use our abdominal muscles. \(NB: Also the position of the tongue can help, relax it when exhaling.\) After we breath out, we can breath in. Be focused on breathing out.

   * **Do not breath out completely**. Leave a bit of the air inside of you so you will not be out of breath. Try to breathe out for 10 seconds and gradually make it longer.
   * **Do not think about emptying your thoughts**. By trying not to think about anything, you ·∫£e already thinking. So just relax and concentrate on breathing. You may think about what you are going to improve in or have achieved during training.

     _This is the basic breathing. Some people may say different duration of each action, but the above mentioned duration of each action \(inhale, hold, and exhale\) seems a common idea. I have also been told that some old schools of swordsmanship taught to count Zen breathing in 7's - 7 second inhale, hold for 7 seconds, exhale over 7 seconds.\)_

### Za-rei

Za-rei is the b∆°ing from seiza. Like ritsu-rei, za-rei has many levels of formality that are applied to its execution. The following outlines the basics of za-rei.

1. Sitting in correct seiza, bend the upper body forward at the hips. At the same time, slide the hands forward over the thighs.
2. As the bow deepens, merge the hands together, creating a triangle with the index fingers and thumbs.
3. At the deepest point of the bow, the back is parallel with the floor. The hands are flat on the floor with the triangular opening, between the index fingers and thumbs, directly below the nose.
4. After holding the bow for a moment, raise the upper body back to the upright posture. At the same time, slide both hands back to their original position.

**Main points:**

* When bowing, the back and neck should remain aligned, keeping correct upper body posture.
* Allowing the head to bob, especially allowing the chin to come to the chest exposes the nape of the neck to the kamiza and/or shinen. This is very poor form and impolite.
* As the upper body bows down, the eyes remain fixed and the gaze follows down to the floor.
* The hips should not rise when the upper body bows downward.
* Exhale as the bow is performed.
